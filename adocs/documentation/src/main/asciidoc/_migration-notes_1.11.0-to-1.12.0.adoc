== `isis.viewer.wicket.disableModalDialogs` removed

The Apache Isis Wicket viewer uses a modal dialog for action parameters.  Before this feature was implemented (prior
to 1.4.0), action parameters were rendered on their own page.  This property was provided to re-enable the old
behaviour.

The property has now been removed and this feature removed; actions parameters are always now always shown in a
 modal dialog.
