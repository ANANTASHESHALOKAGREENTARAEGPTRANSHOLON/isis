[[_rg]]
= Classes, Methods and Schema

This reference guide lists and describes various elements of the the Apache Isis Programming Model, specifically
reserved and prefix xref:rgcms.adoc#_rgcms_methods[methods] (such as `title()` and `validate...()`) and various utility and
supporting xref:rgcms.adoc#_rgcms_classes[classes].

It also describes the xref:rgcms.adoc#_rgcms_schema[XSD schema] defined by Apache Isis.  One use case is for the
JAXB serialization of view models (`1.11.0-SNAPSHOT`).


This reference guide does _not_ describe how to actually build an Apache Isis application; for that see the *xref:ug.adoc#_ug[Users' Guide]*.  The reference guide also doesn't explain how to setup your development environment; for that see the *xref:cg.adoc#_cg[Contributors' Guide]*.
