It's worth extending the xref:ug.adoc#_ug_core-concepts_philosophy_hexagonal-architecture[Hexagonal Architecture] to show where domain services -- and in particular the domain services provided by link:http://www.isisaddons.org[Isis Addons] (non-ASF) -- fit in:

.The hexagonal architecture with Isis addons
image::{_imagesdir}how-tos/domain-services/hexagonal-architecture-addons.png[width="700px"]

Here, we can see that the addons provide services both to the Apache Isis framework (for example security, command and auditing) and also - by way of dependency injection - to the domain objects (eg tags, excel, settings). Of course, you can also write your own domain services as well, for example to interface with some external CMS system, say.

The Apache Isis framework also provides numerous in-built domain services.  These are catalogued in the reference guide, see xref:rg.adoc#_rg_services-api[here] and xref:rg.adoc#_rg_services-spi[here].





== Scoped services

By default all domain services are considered to be singletons, and thread-safe.

Sometimes though a service's lifetime is applicable only to a single request; in other words it is request-scoped.

The CDI annotation xref:rg.adoc#_rg_annotations_manpage-RequestScoped[`@javax.enterprise.context.RequestScoped`] is used to indicate this fact:

[source,java]
----
@javax.enterprise.context.RequestScoped
public class MyService extends AbstractService {
    ...
}
----

The framework provides a number of request-scoped services, include a scratchpad service, query results caching, and support for co-ordinating bulk actions.  See xref:rg.adoc#_rg_services-api[here] and xref:rg.adoc#_rg_services-spi[here] for further details.




== Registering domain services


NOTE: TODO - discuss @DomainService if `isis.services-installer=annotation-and-configuration`; how to override these defaults by explicit registration

Domain services (which includes repositories and factories) can be registered in the `isis.properties` configuration file, under `isis.services` key (a comma-separated list):

For example:

[source,ini]
----
isis.services = com.mycompany.myapp.employee.Employees\,
                com.mycompany.myapp.claim.Claims\,
                ...
----

This will then result in the framework instantiating a single instance of each of the services listed.

If all services reside under a common package, then the `isis.services.prefix` can specify this prefix:

[source,ini]
----
isis.services.prefix = com.mycompany.myapp
isis.services = employee.Employees,\
                claim.Claims,\
                ...
----

This is quite rare, however; you will often want to use default implementations of domain services that are provided by the framework and so will not reside under this prefix.

Examples of framework-provided services (as defined in the applib) include clock, auditing, publishing, exception handling, view model support, snapshots/mementos, and user/application settings management; see the xref:rg.adoc#_rg_services-api[here] and _rg_services-spi[here] for further details.





== Contributions

IMPORTANT: WIP - just xref xref:ug.adoc#_ug_how-tos_contributed-members[contributed members] section.






== Menu items

IMPORTANT: WIP - update to new annotations, including @DomainService(nature=...)


By default every action of a service (by which we also mean repositories and factories) will be rendered in the viewer, eg as a menu item for that service menu. This behaviour can be suppressed by annotating the action using `@org.apache.isis.applib.annotations.NotInServiceMenu`.

For example:

[source,java]
----
public interface Library {
    @NotInServiceMenu
    public Loan borrow(Loanable l, Borrower b);
}
----

Note that an action annotated as being `@NotInServiceMenu` will still be contributed. If an action should neither be contributed nor appear in service menu items, then simply annotate it as `@Hidden`.

Alternatively, this can be performed using a supporting method:

[source,java]
----
public class LibraryImpl implements Library {
    public Loan borrow(Loanable l, Borrower b) { ... }
    public boolean notInServiceMenuBorrow() { ... }
}
----




== Menus

IMPORTANT: WIP - update to new annotations, including @DomainService(nature=...)

If none of the service menu items should appear, then the service itself should be annotated as `@Hidden`.

For example:

[source,java]
----
@Hidden
public interface EmailService {
    public void sendEmail(String to, String from, String subject, String body);
    public void forwardEmail(String to, String from, String subject, String body);
}
----




== Initialization

Services can optionally declare lifecycle callbacks to initialize them (when the app is deployed) and to shut them down (when the app is undeployed).

An Apache Isis session _is_ available when initialization occurs (so services can interact with the object store, for example).


The framework will call any `public` method annotated with xref:rg.adoc#_rg_annotations_manpage-PostConstruct[`@PostConstruct`] with either no arguments of an argument of type `Map<String,String>`

or

In the latter case, the framework passes in the configuration (`isis.properties` and any other component-specific configuration files).


Shutdown is similar; the framework will call any method annotated with xref:rg.adoc#_rg_annotations_manpage-PreDestroy[`@PreDestroy`].




== The getId() method

Optionally, a service may provide a xref:rg.adoc#_rg_methods_reserved_manpage-getId[`getId()`] method.  This method returns a logical identifier for a service, independent of its implementation.
