The Restful Objects viewer provides a couple of configuration option that extend/simplify/alter the representations
generated from the Restful Objects specification.

These configuration properties are typically stored in `WEB-INF/viewer_restfulobjects.properties`.  However, you can
place all configuration properties into `WEB-INF/isis.properties` if you wish (the configuration properties from all
config files are merged together).

[NOTE]
====
As of `1.11.0-SNAPSHOT` these configuration settings should be considered deprecated, because the
xref:ugvro.adoc#_ugvro_simplified-representations[simplified representation] support provided by the Apache Isis profile is a more flexible solution.

Also, be aware enabling these settings makes the representations non-standard with respect to
http://restfulobjects.org[Restful Object spec].

|Property

(_default value_)
|Description

|`isis.viewer.restfulobjects.` +
`honorUiHints`
| `true`,`false` (`_false_`)
|A mechanism for reducing the number of round-trips by eagerly rendering collections; discussed xref:ugvro.adoc#_ugvro_ro-spec_extensions_minimizing-round-trips_honor-ui-hints[here].

|`isis.viewer.restfulobjects.` +
`strictAcceptChecking` +
(`1.11.0-SNAPSHOT`)
| `true`,`false` (`_false_`)
|Whether to strictly enforce the `Accept` header checking for the default RO-spec representations (by the
`ContentNegotiationServiceForRestfulObjectsV1_0` service). Will otherwise accept anything.  +
+
This is convenient because it allows the `Accept` header to be set to that of the
xref:ugvro.adoc#_ugvro_simplified-representations[Apache Isis profile] for all resources, rather than simply the
handful of resources that supported that profile.

|===


There are also a number of configuration properties that can be used to suppress or simplify the default RO-spec
representations.  These pre-date the Apache Isis profile `1.11.0-SNAPSHOT` support, so are considered deprecated.
Discussion of them can nevertheless be found xref:ugvro.adoc#_ugvro_simplified-representations_configuration-properties[here].
