`CommandDtoServiceInternal`]
|(`1.13.0-SNAPSHOT`) Creates memento of current action invocation, for use as a serializable XML reified command.  The
most notable usage of this is to allow the execution of the `Command` to be deferred to run in the background (via
xref:rgant.adoc#_rgant-Action_command[`@Action#commandExecuteIn()`] or
xref:rgant.adoc#_rgant-Property_command[`@Property#commandExecuteIn()`].
