We highly recommend that you develop your Isis application using an IDE. Isis is built with Maven, and all modern IDEs can import Maven projects.

If you are an http://www.eclipse.org[Eclipse] user, then we recommend you download the "Eclipse JEE package" configuration.

When running an Isis application, it's necessary to setup the development environment so that the Java bytecode can be enhanced by the link:http://www.datanucleus.org[DataNucleus] enhancer.  If working in Eclipse, then JDO enhancement is most easily done by installing the http://www.datanucleus.org/products/datanucleus/jdo/guides/eclipse.html[DataNucleus' Eclipse plugin].  This hooks the bytecode enhancement of your domain objects into Eclipse's normal incremental compilation.

This plugin needs to be configured for each of your domain modules (usually just one in any given app).  The steps are therefore:

* import the project into Eclipse
* configure the DataNucleus enhancer
* run the app from the `.launch` file




== Screencast

The following screencast shows how to import an Apache Isis maven-based application into Eclipse and configure to use with the JDO Objectstore

== Importing the Project

Use File &gt; Import, then Maven &gt; Existing Maven Projects.




== Add DataNucleus support

[TIP]
====
Make sure you are in the 'Java' Perspective, not the 'Java EE' Perspective.
====


In Eclipse, for the _domain object model_ project, first add DataNucleus support:

image::{_imagesdir}appendices/dev-env/eclipse/eclipse-100-project-support.png[width="600px",link="{_imagesdir}appendices/dev-env/eclipse/eclipse-100-project-support.png"]


Then turn on Auto-Enhancement:

image::{_imagesdir}appendices/dev-env/eclipse/eclipse-110-project-support.png[width="600px",link="{_imagesdir}appendices/dev-env/eclipse/eclipse-110-project-support.png"]


=== Update the classpath

DataNucleus' enhancer uses the domain object model's own classpath to reference DataNucleus JARs. So, even though your domain objects are unlikely to depend on DataNucleus, these references must still be present.

See the earlier section on xref:ug.adoc#_ug_getting-started_datanucleus-enhancer[DataNucleus enhancer] for details of the contents of the `pom.xml`.  Chances are it is already set up from running the xref:ug.adoc#_ug_getting-started_simpleapp-archetype[SimpleApp archetype].


Then, tell DataNucleus to use the project classpath:


image::{_imagesdir}/appendices/dev-env/eclipse/eclipse-010-windows-preferences.png[width="750px",link="{_imagesdir}/appendices/dev-env/eclipse/eclipse-010-windows-preferences.png"]

When the enhancer runs, it will print out to the console:

image::{_imagesdir}/appendices/dev-env/eclipse/eclipse-120-console.png[width="500px",link="{_imagesdir}/appendices/dev-env/eclipse/eclipse-120-console.png"]



=== Workaround for path limits (the DN plugin to use the persistence.xml)

If running on Windows then the DataNucleus plugin is very likely to hit the Windows path limit.

To fix this, we configure the enhancer to read from the `persistence.xml` file.

As a prerequisite, first make sure that your domain object model has a `persistence.xml` file.  Then specify the `persistence-unit` in the project properties:

image::{_imagesdir}/appendices/dev-env/eclipse/eclipse-025-project-properties.png[width="750px",link="{_imagesdir}/appendices/dev-env/eclipse/eclipse-025-project-properties.png"]


=== Workaround: If the enhancer fails

On occasion it appears that Eclipse can attempt to run two instances of the DataNucleus enhancer. This is probably due to multiple Eclipse builders being defined; we've noticed multiple entries in the Eclipse's `Debug` view:


image::{_imagesdir}/appendices/dev-env/eclipse/eclipse-210-enhancer-fails-duplicates.png[width="600px",link="{_imagesdir}/appendices/dev-env/eclipse/eclipse-210-enhancer-fails-duplicates.png"]


At any rate, you'll know you've encountered this error if you see the following in the console:


image::{_imagesdir}/appendices/dev-env/eclipse/eclipse-200-enhancer-fails-duplicates.png[width="600px",link="{_imagesdir}/appendices/dev-env/eclipse/eclipse-200-enhancer-fails-duplicates.png"]



The best solution is to remove DataNucleus support and then to re-add it:


image::{_imagesdir}/appendices/dev-env/eclipse/eclipse-220-enhancer-fails-duplicates.png[width="600px",link="{_imagesdir}/appendices/dev-env/eclipse/eclipse-220-enhancer-fails-duplicates.png"]


If you consistently hit problems, then the final recourse is to disable the automatic enhancement and to remember to manually enhance your domain object model before each run.

Not ideal, we know. Please feel free to contribute a better solution :-)




== Running the App

The simpleapp archetype automatically provides a `.launch` configurations in the `webapp` module. You can therefore very simply run the application by right-clicking on one of these files, and choosing "Run As…" or "Debug As…".


[NOTE]
====
The screencast above shows this in action.
====





== Other domain projects.

There is nothing to prevent you having multiple domain projects. You might want to do such that each domain project corresponds to a http://www.methodsandtools.com/archive/archive.php?id=97p2[DDD module], thus guaranteeing that there are no cyclic dependencies between your modules.

If you do this, make sure that each project has its own `persistence.xml` file.

And, remember also to configure Eclipse's DataNucleus plugin for these other domain projects.
