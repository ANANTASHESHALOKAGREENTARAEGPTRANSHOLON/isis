The `autoCompleteRepository()` attribute nominates a single method on a domain service as the fallback means for lookuping up instances of the domain object using a simple string.

For example, this might search for a customer by their name or number.  Or it could search for a country based on its ISO-3 code or user-friendly name.


[TIP]
====
If you require additional control - for example restricting the returned results based on the object being interacted with - then use the xref:rg.adoc#_rg_methods_prefixes_manpage-autoComplete[`autoComplete...()`] supporting method instead.
====


For example:

[source,java]
----
@AutoComplete(
    autoCompleteRepository=Customers.class
)
public class Customer extends AbstractDomainObject {
   ....
}
----

where:

[source,java]
----
public interface Customers {
    @Programmatic                                // <1>
    List<Customer> autoComplete(String search);  // <2>
    ...
}
----
<1> do not expose in the UI
<2> is assumed to be called "autoComplete", and accepts a single string



== `autoCompleteAction()`

As noted above, by default the method invoked on the repository is assumed to be called "autoComplete".  The optional `autoCompleteAction()` attribute allows the method on the repository to be overridden.


For example:

[source,java]
----
@AutoComplete(
    autoCompleteRepository=Customers.class,
    autoCompleteAction="findByCustomerName"
)
public class Customer extends AbstractDomainObject {
   ....
}
----

where in this case `findByCustomerName` might be an existing method already defined:

[source,java]
----
public interface Customers {
    @Action(semantics=SemanticsOf.SAFE)
    List<Customer> findByCustomerName(@ParameterLayout(named="name") String name);
    ...
}
----



[IMPORTANT]
====
The method specified must be an action, that is, part of the Isis metamodel.  Said another way: it must not be annotated with xref:rgant.adoc#_rgant-Programmatic[`@Programmatic`].  However, it *can* be hidden or placed on a domain service with xref:rgant.adoc#_rgant-DomainService_nature[nature] of `DOMAIN`, such that the action would not be rendered otherwise in the UI.  Also, the action cannot be xref:rgant.adoc#_rgant-Action_restrictTo[restricted to] prototyping only.
