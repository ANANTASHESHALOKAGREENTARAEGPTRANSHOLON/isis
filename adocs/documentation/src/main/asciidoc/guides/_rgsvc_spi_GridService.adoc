The `GridService` provides the ability to load the XML layout (grid) for a domain class.   To do this it delegates:

* to xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_spi_GridLoaderService[`GridLoaderService`] to load a pre-existing layout for the domain class, if possible

* to xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_spi_GridSystemService[`GridSystemService`] to normalize the grid with respect to Apache
Isis' internal metamodel, in other words to ensure that all of the domain objects' properties, collections and actions are associated with regions of the grid.

Once a grid has been loaded for a domain class, this is cached internally by Apache Isis' internal meta model (in the
`GridFacet` facet).  Note that that (if running in prototype mode, at least), any subsequent changes to the XML will be detected and the grid rebuilt.  This allows for dynamic layouts.
