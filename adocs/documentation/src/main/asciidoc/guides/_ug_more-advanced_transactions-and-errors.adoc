In Isis, every action invocation (in fact, every interaction) is automatically wrapped in a transaction, and any repository query automatically does a flush.

What that means is that there's no need to explicitly start or commit transactions in Isis; this will be done for you. Indeed, if you do try to manage transactions (eg by reaching into the JDO `PersistenceManager` exposed by the xref:rg.adoc#_rg_services-api_manpage-IsisJdoSupport[IsisJdoSupport] domain service, then you are likely to confuse Isis and get a stack trace for your trouble.




== Aborting Transactions

If you want to abort Isis' transaction, this can be done by throwing `RecoverableException` (or any subclass, eg `ApplicationException`). The transaction will be aborted, and the exception message will be displayed to the user.

If you throw any other exception (ie not a subclass of `RecoverableException`), then the users will see an error page (if Wicket viewer) or a 500 (if Restful Objects viewer).

== Exception Recognizers
