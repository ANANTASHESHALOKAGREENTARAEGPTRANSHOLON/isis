(As of `1.12.0-SNAPSHOT`) the framework provides a single mixin that contributes to simply `java.lang.Object`.  It provides the ability to download the layout XML for any domain object (in practical terms: entities and view models).


The `Object_downloadLayoutXml` mixin defines the following action:

[source,java]
----
@Mixin
public class Object_downloadLayoutXml {
    public Object_downloadLayoutXml(final Object object) { ... }     // <1>
    public String downloadLayoutXml(final String fileName) { ... }   // <2>
    ...
}
----
<1> provided as an action to all objects
<2> actually this method is called '$$' in the code, a "special case" that means to use the derive the action name
from the class name.


== Appearance in the UI

This mixin property are all associated with the "Metadata" fieldset.

A number of other xref:rgcms.adoc#_rgcms_classes_mixins_Persistable[mixins] also contribute properties and actions to the "Metadata" fieldset.



== Related Services

This mixin calls xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_api_LayoutService[`LayoutService`] to obtain the layout XML.
