The `org.apache.isis.applib.layout` package ...

NOTE: TODO


[[_rgcms_classes_layout_component]]
== Component

NOTE: TODO

Consists of:

* `Grid` +
+
Top level container for a custom layout for a domain object.  `Grid` itself is an interface; it is the xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_spi_GridSystemService[`GridSystemService`] that defines a concrete implementation.  The framework itself provides one implementation, for bootstrap3; its concrete classes are discussed xref:rgcms.adoc#_rgcms_classes_layout_grid-bootstrap3[below].

* `FieldSet` +
+
A fieldset (previously also called a property group or member group) of a number of the domain object's properties
(along with any associationed actions of those properties).

* layout data classes, which correspond to the similarly named annotations:

** `PropertyLayoutData` (corresponding to the xref:rgant.adoc#_rgant_PropertyLayout[`@PropertyLayout`] annotation)

** `CollectionLayoutData` (corresponding to the xref:rgant.adoc#_rgant_CollectionLayout[`@CollectionLayout`] annotation)

** `ActionLayoutData` (corresponding to the xref:rgant.adoc#_rgant_ActionLayout[`@ActionLayout`] annotation)

** `DomainObjectLayoutData` (corresponding to the xref:rgant.adoc#_rgant_DomainObjectLayout[`@DomainObjectLayout`] annotation)



[[_rgcms_classes_layout_grid-bootstrap3]]
