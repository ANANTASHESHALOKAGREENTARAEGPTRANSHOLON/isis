The `isis.properties` file has four configuration properties in particular that specify the major components of Apache Isis to use.

They are:

.Core Configuration Properties
[cols="2a,1,3a", options="header"]
|===
|Property
|Value +
(_default value_)
|Implements

|`isis.authentication`
|`shiro`, `bypass`, `FQCN` +
(`_shiro_`)
|`o.a.i.core.runtime.authentication.` `AuthenticationManagerInstaller`

|`isis.authorization`
|`shiro`, `bypass`, `FQCN` +
(`_shiro_`)
|`o.a.i.core.runtime.authorization.` `AuthorizationManagerInstaller`

|`isis.persistor`
|`datanucleus`, `inmemory`, `FQCN` +
(`_datanucleus_`)
|`o.a.i.core.runtime.installerregistry.installerapi.` `PersistenceMechanismInstaller`

|`isis.services-installer`
|`configuration`, `configuration-and-annotation`, `FQCN` +
(`_configuration_`)
|`org.apache.isis.core.runtime.services.` `ServicesInstaller` +

The mechanism to discover and load domain services:

* `configuration-and-annotation` will search for `@DomainService`-annotated classes and also read from `isis.services` configuration property

* `configuration` will only read from the `isis.services` configuration property. +

* Otherwise an alternative implementation of the `o.a.i.core.runtime.services.ServicesInstaller` internal API can be provided.



|===

[TIP]
====
The values "datanucleus", "shiro" etc are actually aliases for concrete implementations listed in Apache Isis' `installer-registry.properties` file (in `isis-core-runtime.jar`).
====

It is -- at least in theory -- possible to specify a fully qualified class name to replace any of these components.  This is probably feasible for the two security APIs and the `services-installer` API; but replacing the persistor (JDO/DataNucleus) is much trickier because we rely on the JDO/DN for certain functionality (such as object dirtying and lazy loading) that is not defined within this API.

As for the viewers, these are specified indirectly by way of the filters and servlets in the `web.xml` file (discussed xref:rg.adoc#_rg_runtime_web-xml[below]).  However, the configuration of which viewers to initialize is declared through a context parameter:


[source,xml]
----
<context-param>
    <param-name>isis.viewers</param-name>
    <param-value>wicket,restfulobjects</param-value>
</context-param>
----

The net effect of this configuration is simply to ensure that the `viewer_wicket.properties` and/or the `viewer_restfulobjects.properties` files are read.
