If all that is required is a very simple representations (of objects), you can configure the Restful Objects viewer
to provide a simplified output, then this can be done with a number of (global) configuration properties.

These configuration properties pre-date the support, introduced in `1.11.0-SNAPSHOT`, for the Apache Isis profile, and
are limited by the fact that they are global configuration settings, so cannot be influenced on a request-by-request
basis (as is the case with the `Accept` header used for the Apache Isis profile). They have therefore been
deprecated, and may be removed in the future.

Nevertheless, those configuration properties are:

|===


For example, these configuration properties could all be added in the `WEB-INF/viewer_restfulobjects.properties`):

[source,ini]
----
isis.viewer.restfulobjects.suppressDescribedByLinks=true
isis.viewer.restfulobjects.suppressUpdateLink=true
isis.viewer.restfulobjects.suppressMemberId=true
isis.viewer.restfulobjects.suppressMemberLinks=true
isis.viewer.restfulobjects.suppressMemberExtensions=true
isis.viewer.restfulobjects.suppressMemberDisabledReason=true
----


[NOTE]
====
If these configuration settings are set in conjunction with using the
xref:ugvro.adoc#_ugvro_simplified-representations_apache-isis-profile[Apache Isis profile], then the special `$$ro`
property in the representations with reflect these settings.
====



If the `objectPropertyValuesOnly` configuration property is set:

[source,ini]
----
isis.viewer.restfulobjects.objectPropertyValuesOnly=true
----

then this generates a representation such as:

[source,javascript]
----
{
    "title" : "Buy milk due by 2014-10-27",
    "domainType" : "TODO",
    "instanceId" : "0",
    "members" : {
        "description" : "Buy milk",
        "category" : "Domestic",
        "subcategory" : "Shopping",
        "complete" : false,
        "versionSequence" : 1,
        "relativePriority" : 2,
        "dueBy" : "2014-10-27",
        "cost" : "0.75",
        "notes" : null,
        "attachment" : null,
        "doc" : null
    },
    "links" : [

            "method" : "GET",
            "type" : "application/json;profile=\"urn:org.restfulobjects:repr-types/object\"",
            "title" : "Buy milk due by 2014-10-27"
        },
        {
            "rel" : "describedby",
