Subclass of xref:rgcms.adoc#_rgcms_classes_domainevent_AbstractDomainEvent[`AbstractDomainEvent`] for actions.

The class has a number of responsibilities (in addition to those it inherits):

* capture the target object being interacted with

* capture the arguments for each of the action's parameters

* provide selected metadata about the action parameters from the metamodel (names, types)

* link back to the xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc-api_CommandContext[`CommandContext`] service's `Command` object

The class itself is instantiated automatically by the framework whenever interacting with a rendered object's action.
