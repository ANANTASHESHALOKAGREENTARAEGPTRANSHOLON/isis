Metadata providing UI hints can be specified either xref:ugfun.adoc#_ugfun_object-layout_static[statically], using annotations, or dynamically using an `Xxx.layout.xml` file (where `Xxx` is the entity or view model object to be rendered).

A corresponding XSD schema for the XML file makes it easy to author such layout files.  It is also possible to download an initial `.layout.xml` - capturing any existing layout metadata using the xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_api_MetamodelService[`MetamodelService`] (exposed on the prototyping menu).

[NOTE]
====
It is also possible to describe dynamic layouts using a `.layout.json` file, as discussed xref:ugfun.adoc#_ugfun_object-layout_dynamic[here].  As of `1.12.0-SNAPSHOT` the `.layout.json` file should be considered as deprecated: the ``.layout.xml`` file also allows enables much more sophisticated custom layouts than those afforded by ``.layout.json``, and the layout files are easier to write due to the presence of an XSD schema file which ensures that the file is syntactically correct.

== Grids vs Components

The XML file distinguishes between two types of element:

* those that define a grid structure, of: rows, columns, tabgroups and tabs. +
+
The rows and columns are closely modelled on link:getbootstrap.com[bootstrap 3] (used in the implementation of the xref:ugvw.adoc[Wicket viewer]).

* those that defines common components, of: fieldsets (previously called member groups or property groups), properties, collections, actions and also the title/icon of the domain object itself.

These two different element types have their own XSD namespaces, the rationale being that in the future there may be alternative
grid structures defined that use the same common components, eg link:http://foundation.zurb.com/[Zurb Foundation], or perhaps
a set of proprietary and more opinionated grids, eg 3 column or master/detail.  For the moment however the Bootstrap3
grid provides a great deal of flexibility while being one of the most commonly used grid frameworks.  

[TIP]
====
More information on Bootstrap 3's grid system can be found link:http://getbootstrap.com/css/#grid[here].

== Examples

Probably the easiest way to understand dynamic XML layouts is to see some examples.


== Syntax

=== Namespaces

=== Unreferenced


== Migrating from earlier versions


There are three levels:

* complete
* normalized
* minimal


Download either for a single domain object, or download all domain objects (entities and view models).


== Domain Services

GridService and GridNormalizerService.
