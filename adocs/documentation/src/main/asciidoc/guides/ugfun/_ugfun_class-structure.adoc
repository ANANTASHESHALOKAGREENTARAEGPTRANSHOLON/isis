Apache Isis works by building a metamodel of the domain objects: entities, domain services, view models and mixins.
Dependent on the sort of domain object, the class methods represent
both state -- (single-valued) properties and (multi-valued) collections -- and behaviour -- actions.

More specifically, both entities and view models can have properties, collections and actions, while domain services have just actions.
Mixins also define only actions, though depending on their semantics they may be rendered as derived properties or collections on the domain object to which they contribute.

In the automatically generated UI a property is rendered as a field.
This can be either of a value type (a string, number, date, boolean etc) or can be a reference to another entity.
A collection is generally rendered as a table.

In order for Apache Isis to build its metamodel the domain objects must follow some conventions: what we call the _Apache Isis Programming Model_.
This is just an extension of the pojo / JavaBean standard of yesteryear: properties and collections are getters/setters, while actions are simply any remaining `public` methods.

Additional metamodel semantics are inferred both imperatively from _supporting methods_ and declaratively from annotations.

In this section we discuss the mechanics of writing domain objects that comply with Apache Isis' programming model.

[TIP]
====
In fact, the Apache Isis programming model is extensible; you can teach Apache Isis new programming conventions and you can remove existing ones; ultimately they amount to syntax.
The only real fundamental that can't be changed is the notion that objects consist of properties, collections and actions.

You can learn more about extending Apache Isis programming model xref:../ugbtb/ugbtb.adoc#_ugbtb_programming-model[here].
