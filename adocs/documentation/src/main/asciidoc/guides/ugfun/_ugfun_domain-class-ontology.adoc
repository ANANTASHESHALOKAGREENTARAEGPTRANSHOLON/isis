Apache Isis supports recognises four main types of domain classes:

* xref:../ugfun/ugfun.adoc#_ugfun_domain-class-ontology_domain-entities[domain entities] - domain objects persisted to the database using JDO/DataNucleus; for example `Customer`

* xref:../ugfun/ugfun.adoc#_ugfun_domain-class-ontology_domain-services[domain services] - generally singletons, automatically injected, and providing various functionality; for example `CustomerRepository`

* xref:../ugfun/ugfun.adoc#_ugfun_domain-class-ontology_view-models[view models] - domain objects that are a projection of some state held by the database, in support a particular use case; for example `CustomerDashboard` (to pull together commonly accessed information about a customer).

* xref:../ugfun/ugfun.adoc#_ugfun_domain-class-ontology_mixins[mixins] - allow functionality to be "contributed" in the UI by one module to another object, similar to traits or extension methods provided in some programming languages.
This is an important capability to help keep large applications decoupled.

Domain classes are generally recognized using annotations.
Apache Isis defines its own set of annotations, while entities are annotated using JDO/DataNucleus (though XML can also be used if required).
JAXB can also be used for view models.
Apache Isis recognizes some of the JDO and JAXB annotations and infers domain semantics from these annotations.

You can generally recognize an Apache Isis domain class because it will be probably be annotated using `@DomainObject` and `@DomainService`.
The framework also defines supplementary annotations, `@DomainObjectLayout` and `@DomainServiceLayout`.
These provide hints relating to the layout of the domain object in the user interface.
(Alternatively, these UI hints can be defined in a supplementary xref:../ugvw/ugvw.adoc#_ugvw_layout[`.layout.xml`] file.

We use Maven modules as a way to group related domain objects together; we can then reason about all the classes in that module as a single unit.
By convention there will be a single top-level package corresponding to the module.

For example, the (non-ASF) link:https://github.com/incodehq/incode-module-document[Document module] (part of the link:http://catalog.incode.org[Incode Catalog]) has a top-level package of `org.incode.module.document`.
Within the module there may be various subpackages, but its the module defines the namespace.

In the same way that the Java module act as a namespace for domain objects, it's good practice to map domain entities to their own (database) schemas.
