Once a domain entity has been instantiated, it must be persisted.
This is done using the xref:../rgsvc/rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_api_RepositoryService[`RepositoryService`].
For example:

[source,java]
----
Customer customer = ...

repositoryService.persist(customer);
----

If using the no-arg form to instantiate the entity, then (to save having to inject two services), the `RepositoryService` can also be used to instantiate.
This gives rise to this common idiom:

[source,java]
----
Customer customer = repositoryService.instantiate(Customer.class);
customer.setReference(reference);
customer.setFirstName(firstName);
customer.setLastName(lastName);
...
repositoryService.persist(customer);
----




[TIP]
====
It is also possible to configure DataNucleus to automatically persist domain entities if they are associated with other already-persistent entities.
This avoid the need to explicitly call "persist".

For this, configure the persistence-by-reachability property:

.isis.properties
[source,ini]
----
isis.persistor.datanucleus.impl.datanucleus.persistenceByReachabilityAtCommit=true
----

The downside is that the code is arguably less easy to debug.
