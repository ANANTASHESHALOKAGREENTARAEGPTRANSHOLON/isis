The link:http://www.isisaddons.org[Isis Addons] website provides a number of reusable modules for Apache Isis, focusing either on specific technologies or in technical cross-cutting concerns.
Some of these modules implement SPIs defined by the framework.

The link:http://catalog.incode.org[Incode Catalog] website also provides a number of reusable modules, focusing on business logic for generic subdomains.

This section surveys the functionality available.


[WARNING]
====
Note that Isis Addons and Incode Catalog, although maintained by Apache Isis committers, are not part of the ASF.
====



The modules themselves fall into a number of broader groups:

* modules that provide an implementations of SPI defined by Apache Isis +
+
where Apache Isis has hooks to use the service if defined by provides no implementations of its own. +
+
From the link:http://www.isisaddons.org[Isis Addons] website, the http://github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-command[command], http://github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-audit[auditer], http://github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-publishmq[publisher], http://github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-security[security]  and http://github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-sessionlogger[sessionlogger] modules fall into this category.  Typically the domain objects themselves wouldn't interact with these services

* modules that provide standalone domain services with their own API and implementation +
+
These are simply intended to be used by domain objects. +
+

http://github.com/incodehq/incode-module-document[document] and http://github.com/incodehq/incode-module-document[note] modules fall into this category.

* modules that provide standalone domain entities (and supporting services) for a particular subdomain +
+
From the link:http://www.isisaddons.org[Isis Addons] website, the http://github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-tags[tags] module falls into this category

* modules that provide developer/testing utilities +
+
From the link:http://www.isisaddons.org[Isis Addons] website, the http://github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-fakedata[fakedata] module provides fakedata for unit- and integration testing +
+

* modules that support runtime/integration support +
+
From the link:http://www.isisaddons.org[Isis Addons] website, link:http://github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-flywaydb[flywaydb] handle RDBMS schema migration, http://github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-quartz[quartz] provides scheduling of background jobs; and the http://github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-togglz[togglz] provides feature toggles.

Each of the modules has a full README and demo application demonstrating their usage.  The sections below briefly outline the capabilities of these modules.
