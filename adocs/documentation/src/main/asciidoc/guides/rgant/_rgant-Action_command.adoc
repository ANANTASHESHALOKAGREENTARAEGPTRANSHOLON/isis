The `@Action(command=...)` attribute (and the related `@Action(commandPersistence=...)` and  `@Action(commandExecuteIn=...)` attributes) allows an action invocation to be made into a concrete object such that it can be inspected and persisted.
The primary use case for this are to support the deferring the execution of the action such that it can be invoked in the background, and to replay commands in a master/slave configuration.



The annotation works with (and is influenced by the behaviour of) a number of domain services:

* xref:../rgsvc/rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_application-layer-api_CommandContext[`CommandContext`]
* xref:../rgsvc/rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_application-layer-spi_CommandService[`CommandService`]
* xref:../rgsvc/rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_spi_BackgroundService[`BackgroundService`] and
* xref:../rgsvc/rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_application-layer-spi_BackgroundCommandService[`BackgroundCommandService`]


Each action invocation is reified by the xref:../rgsvc/rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_application-layer-api_CommandContext[`CommandContext`] service into a `Command` object, capturing details of the target object, the action, the parameter arguments, the user, a timestamp and so on.

If an appropriate `CommandService` is configured (for example using (non-ASF) link:http://platform.incode.org/modules/spi/command/spi-command.html[Incode Platform's command] module), then the `Command` itself is persisted.

By default, actions are invoked in directly in the thread of the invocation.
If there is an implementation of `BackgroundCommandService` (as the (non-ASF) link:http://platform.incode.org[Incode Platform^]'s command module does provide), then this means in turn that the `BackgroundService` can be used by the domain object code to programmatically create background ``Command``s.

[NOTE]
====
If background ``Command``s are used, then an external scheduler, using xref:../ugbtb/ugbtb.adoc#_ugbtb_headless-access_BackgroundCommandExecution[headless access], must also be configured.
====



The `command()` attribute determines whether the action invocation should be reified into a `Command` object (by the xref:../rgsvc/rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_application-layer-api_CommandContext[`CommandContext`] service).

The default is `AS_CONFIGURED`, meaning that the xref:../rgcfg/rgcfg.adoc#_rgcfg_configuring-core[configuration property] `isis.services.command.actions` is used to determine the whether the action is reified:

* `all` +
+
all actions are reified

* `ignoreSafe` (or `ignoreQueryOnly`) +
+
actions with safe (read-only) semantics are ignored, but actions which may modify data are not ignored

* `none` +
+
no actions are reified.

If there is no configuration property in `isis.properties` then all actions are reified into ``Command``s.

[NOTE]
====
Note: `Command` reification does not necessarily imply that `Command` objects will be persisted; that depends on whether there is a xref:../rgsvc/rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_application-layer-spi_CommandService[`CommandService`] configured that will persist said ``Command``s.
====

This default can be overridden on an action-by-action basis; if `command()` is set to `ENABLED` then the action is reified irrespective of the configured value; if set to `DISABLED` then the action is NOT reified irrespective of the configured value.

For example:

[source,java]
----
public class Order {
    @Action(command=CommandReification.ENABLED)
    public Invoice generateInvoice(...) { ... }
}
----

corresponds to the behaviour described above; the `Command` object is persisted (assuming an appropriate `CommandService` is defined, and executed immediately in the foreground).




== `commandPersistence()`

If the action has been reified, then the `commandPersistence()` attribute determines whether that `Command` object should then also be persisted (the default), or not persisted, or only if hinted.

To explain this last alternative:

[source,java]
----
public class Order {
    @Action(
        command=CommandReification.ENABLED,
        commandPersistence=CommandPersistence.IF_HINTED
    )
    public Invoice generateInvoice(...) { ... }
}
----

will suppress the persistence of the `Command` object _unless_ a child background `Command` has been created in the body of the action by way of the xref:../rgsvc/rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_application-layer-api_BackgroundService[`BackgroundService`].

On the other hand:

[source,java]
----
public class Order {
    @Action(
        command=CommandReification.ENABLED,
        commandExecuteIn=CommandExecuteIn.FOREGROUND,
        commandPersistence=CommandPersistence.NOT_PERSISTED
    )
    public Invoice generateInvoice(...) { ... }
}
----

will prevent the parent `Command` object from being persisted, _even if_ a child background `Command` is created.




== `commandExecuteIn()`

For persisted commands, the `commandExecuteIn()` attribute determines whether the `Command` should be executed in the foreground (the default) or executed in the background.

Background execution means that the command is not executed immediately, but is available for a configured xref:../rgsvc/rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_application-layer-spi_BackgroundCommandService[`BackgroundCommandService`] to execute, eg by way of an in-memory scheduler such as Quartz.  See xref:../ugbtb/ugbtb.adoc#_ugbtb_headless-access_BackgroundCommandExecution[here] for further information on this topic.

For example:

[source,java]
----
public class Order {
    @Action(
        command=CommandReification.ENABLED,
        commandExecuteIn=CommandExecuteIn.BACKGROUND)
    public Invoice generateInvoice(...) { ... }
}
----

will result in the `Command` being persisted but its execution deferred to a background execution mechanism.
The returned object from this action is the persisted `Command` itself.




== `commandWithDtoProcessor()`

The `commandWithDtoProcessor()` attribute allows an implementation of `CommandWithDtoProcessor` to be specified.
This has the following API:

[source,java]
----
public interface CommandWithDtoProcessor {
    CommandDto process(CommandWithDto commandWithDto);
}
----

This interface is used by the framework-provided implementations of `ContentMappingService` for the REST API, allowing ``Command``s implementations that also implement `CommandWithDto` to be further customised as they are serialized out.
The primary use case for this capability is in support of master/slave replication.

* on the master, ``Command``s are serialized to XML.
This includes the identity of the target object and the value of all parameters.
However, any ``Blob``s and ``Clob``s are deliberately excluded from this XML (they are instead stored as references).

* replaying ``Command``s requires this missing parameter information to be reinstated.
The `CommandWithDtoProcessor` therefore offers a hook to dynamically re-attach the missing `Blob` or `Clob` argument.


As a special case, returning `null` means that the command's DTO is effectively excluded when retrieving the list of commands.
If replicating from master to slave, this effectively allows certain commands to be ignored.
The `CommandWithDtoProcessor.Null` class provides a convenience implementation for this requirement.

[NOTE]
====
If `commandWithDtoProcessor()` is specified, then `command()` is assumed to be ENABLED.

=== Example implementation

Consider the following method:

[source,java]
----
@Action(
    domainEvent = IncomingDocumentRepository.UploadDomainEvent.class,
    commandWithDtoProcessor = DeriveBlobArg0FromReturnedDocument.class
)
public Document upload(final Blob blob) {
    final String name = blob.getName();
    final DocumentType type = DocumentTypeData.INCOMING.findUsing(documentTypeRepository);
    final ApplicationUser me = meService.me();
    String atPath = me != null ? me.getAtPath() : null;
    if (atPath == null) {
        atPath = "/";
    }
    return incomingDocumentRepository.upsertAndArchive(type, atPath, name, blob);
}
----

The `Blob` argument will not be persisted in the memento of the `Command`, but the information is implicitly available in the `Document` that is returned by the action.
The `DeriveBlobArg0FromReturnedDocument` processor retrieves this information and dynamically adds:

[source,java]
----
public class DeriveBlobArg0FromReturnedDocument
        extends CommandWithDtoProcessorForActionAbstract {

    @Override
    public CommandDto process(final CommandWithDto commandWithDto) {
        final CommandDto commandDto = commandWithDto.asDto();
        final Bookmark result = commandWithDto.getResult();
        if(result == null) {
            return commandDto;
        }
        try {
            final Document document = bookmarkService.lookup(result, Document.class);
            if (document != null) {
                ParamDto paramDto = getParamDto(commandDto, 0);
                CommonDtoUtils.setValueOn(paramDto, ValueType.BLOB, document.getBlob(), bookmarkService);
            }
        } catch(Exception ex) {
            return commandDto;
        }
        return commandDto;
    }
    @Inject
    BookmarkService bookmarkService;
}
----


=== Null implementation



[source,xml]
----
    /**
     * Convenience implementation to simply indicate that no DTO should be returned for a command,
     * effectively ignoring it for replay purposes.
     */
    public static class Null implements CommandWithDtoProcessor {
        @Override
        public CommandDto process(final CommandWithDto commandWithDto) {
            return null;
        }
    }
