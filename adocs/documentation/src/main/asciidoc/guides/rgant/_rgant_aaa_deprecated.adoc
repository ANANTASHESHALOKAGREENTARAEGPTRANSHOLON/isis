As Apache Isis has evolved and grown, we found ourselves adding more and more annotations; but most of these related to either an object type (entity, view model, service) or an object member (property, collection, action).
Over time it became harder and harder for end programmers to discover these new features.

Accordingly, (in v1.8.0) we decided to unify the semantics into the main (core) annotations listed xref:../rgant/rgant.adoc#_rgant-aaa_main[above].

The annotations listed in the table below are still supported by Apache Isis, but will be retired in Apache Isis v2.0.


.Deprecated Annotations
[cols="2,4a,3a,1,1", options="header"]

|Annotation
|Purpose
|Use instead
|Layer
|xref:../ugvw/ugvw.adoc#_ugvw_layout_file-based[File-based layout]?

|`@Bulk`
|Indicates an action is a bulk action, can be applied to multiple instances.
|xref:../rgant/rgant.adoc#_rgant-Action_invokeOn[`@Action#invokeOn()`]
|UI, Domain
|


|`@Immutable`
|An object's state cannot be changed (properties cannot be edited, collections cannot be added to or removed from).
Actions can still be invoked.
|xref:../rgant/rgant.adoc#_rgant-DomainObject_editing[`@DomainObject#editing()`]
|Domain
|


|`@MustSatisfy`
|Specify arbitrary specification constraints on a property or action parameter.
|`#mustSatisfy()` attribute for xref:../rgant/rgant.adoc#_rgant-Property_mustSatisfy[`@Property`] or xref:../rgant/rgant.adoc#_rgant-Parameter_mustSatisfy[`@Parameter`]
|Domain
|


|`@NotContributed`
|Indicates that a domain service action is not rendered as an action on the (entity) types of its parameters.
For 1-arg query-only actions, controls whether the domain service action is rendered as a property or collection on the entity type of its parameter.
|Use xref:../rgant/rgant.adoc#_rgant-DomainService_nature[`@DomainService#nature()`] to specify whether any of the actions in a domain service should appear in the menu bars (applies at type level, not action level).
For individual actions, use xref:../rgant/rgant.adoc#_rgant-ActionLayout_contributedAs[`@ActionLayout#` +
`contributedAs()`] to specify whether any individual action should be contributed only as an action or as an association (property or collection).
|UI
|

|`@NotInServiceMenu`
|Indicates that a domain service should not be rendered in the application menu (at top of page in Wicket viewer).
|xref:../rgant/rgant.adoc#_rgant-DomainService_nature[`@DomainService#nature()`] to signify that none of the actions in a domain service should appear in the menu bars
|UI
|

|`@NotPersisted`
|Indicates that an object property is not persisted (meaning it is excluded from view model mementos, and should not be audited).
|`#notPersisted()` attribute of xref:../rgant/rgant.adoc#_rgant-Property_notPersisted[`@Property`] and xref:../rgant/rgant.adoc#_rgant-Collection_notPersisted[`@Collection`]
|Domain, Persistence
|

|`@ObjectType`
|For constructing the external identifier (URI) of an entity instance (part of its URL in both Wicket viewer and Restful Objects viewer).
Also part of the toString representation of bookmarks, if using the Bookmark Service
|xref:../rgant/rgant.adoc#_rgant-DomainObject_objectType[`@DomainObject#objectType()`]
|Domain
|

|`@Optional`
|Specifies that a property or action parameter is not mandatory.
|`#optionality()` attribute for xref:../rgant/rgant.adoc#_rgant-Property_optionality[`@Property`] or  xref:../rgant/rgant.adoc#_rgant-Parameter_optionality[`@Parameter`]
|Domain
|


|`@RegEx`
|Validate change to value of string property.
|`#regexPattern()` for xref:../rgant/rgant.adoc#_rgant-Property_regexPattern[`@Property`] or  xref:../rgant/rgant.adoc#_rgant-Property_regexPattern[`@Parameter`].
|Domain
