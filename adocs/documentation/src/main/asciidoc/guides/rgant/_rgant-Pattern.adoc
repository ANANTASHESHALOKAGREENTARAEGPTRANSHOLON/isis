The `@javax.validation.constraints.Pattern` annotation is recognized by Apache Isis as a means to specify a regular expression constraint for properties and action parameters of type `java.lang.String`.

For example:

[source,java]
----
@javax.validation.constraints.Pattern(
    regexp="[A-Z].+"
    message="Must begin with a capital."
)
public String getName() {
    return name;
}
...
----


It is also possible to specify against a field if Lombok is being used:


[source,java]
----
@javax.validation.constraints.Pattern(
    regexp="[A-Z].+"
    message="Must begin with a capital."
)
@lombok.Getter @lombok.Setter
private String name;
----
