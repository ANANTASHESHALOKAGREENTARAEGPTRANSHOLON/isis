The `hide...()` supporting method is called for properties, collections and actions.
It allows the property/collection to be completely hidden from view.

It's comparatively rare for properties or collections to be imperatively hidden from view, but actions are sometimes hidden or shown visible (as opposed to being just xref:rgcms.adoc#_rgcms_methods_prefixes_disable[disabled], ie greyed out).


The signature of the supporting method is simply:

[source,java]
----
public bool hideXxx() { ... }
----

Returning `true` will hide the property, collection or action, returning `false` leaves it visible.


For example, to hide an action:

[source,java]
----
public class Customer {
    public boolean isBlacklisted() { ... }

    public Order placeOrder(
            final Product product,
            @ParameterLayout(named="Quantity")
            final int quantity) {
        ...
    }
    public boolean hidePlaceOrder() {
        return isBlacklisted();
    }
    ...
}
----


Or, to hide a property:

[source,java]
----
public class Customer {
    public boolean isBlacklisted() { ... }

    public BigDecimal getCreditLimit() { ... }
    public void setCreditLimit(BigDecimal creditLimit) { ... }
    public boolean hideCreditLimit() {
        return isBlacklisted();
    }
    ...
}
----


[NOTE]
====
In the case of actions, the framework will also search for supporting method that has the exact same parameter types as the action itself.
(As of `1.14.0-SNAPSHOT`) enabling `isis.reflector.validator.noParamsOnly` configuration property switches this off, so that the framework will only search for supporting method with no parameters.

Note that enabling this configuration property in effect means that xref:rgcms.adoc#_rgcms_classes_mixins[mixins] must be used instead of xref:ugbtb.adoc#_ugbtb_decoupling_contributions[contributed services] (because contributed actions are the one case where the value of a parameter to a supporting method may be non-null).
