The `hide...()` supporting method is called for properties, collections and actions.
It allows the property/collection to be completely hidden from view.

It's comparatively rare for properties or collections to be imperatively hidden from view, but actions are sometimes hidden or shown visible (as opposed to being just xref:rgcms.adoc#_rgcms_methods_prefixes_disable[disabled], ie greyed out).


The signature of the supporting method is simply:

[source,java]
----
public bool hideXxx() { ... }
----

Returning `true` will hide the property, collection or action, returning `false` leaves it visible.


For example, to hide an action:

[source,java]
----
public class Customer {
    public boolean isBlacklisted() { ... }

    public Order placeOrder(
            final Product product,
            @ParameterLayout(named="Quantity")
            final int quantity) {
        ...
    }
    public boolean hidePlaceOrder() {
        return isBlacklisted();
    }
    ...
}
----


Or, to hide a property:

[source,java]
----
public class Customer {
    public boolean isBlacklisted() { ... }

    public BigDecimal getCreditLimit() { ... }
    public void setCreditLimit(BigDecimal creditLimit) { ... }
    public boolean hideCreditLimit() {
        return isBlacklisted();
    }
    ...
}
----


[NOTE]
====
(As of `1.14.0-SNAPSHOT`), by default only supporting methods with no parameters are recognized.
By enabling `isis.reflector.validator.noParamsOnly` configuration property, the framework will also match the supporting method if its parameter types are the same as that of the action.
However, this functionality may be removed in the future (the arguments are always set to null so of no practical use).
