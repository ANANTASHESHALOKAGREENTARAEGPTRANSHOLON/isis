The `CommandMementoService` (`1.13.0-SNAPSHOT`) is responsible for creating a memento of a current action invocation,
to store in the `Command` object (from xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_api_CommandContext[`CommandContext`]).
This memento can be reified for use either in xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_spi_BackgroundCommandService[background command]s, or to be published using xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_spi_PublishingService[`PublishingService`].




== SPI & Implementation

The SPI of the service is:

[source,java]
----
public interface CommandMementoService {
    @Programmatic
    ActionInvocationMemento asActionInvocationMemento(
                        Method m, Object domainObject, Object[] args);
}
----

The default implementation is provided by core (`o.a.i.core.runtime.services.command.CommandMementoServiceDefault`).




== Registering the Services

Assuming that the `configuration-and-annotation` services installer is configured (implicit if using the
`AppManifest` to xref:rgcms.adoc#_rgcms_classes_AppManifest-bootstrapping[bootstrap the app]) then Apache Isis' core
implementation of `CommandMementoService` is automatically registered (it is annotated with `@DomainService`) so no
further configuration is required.

To use an alternative implementation, use
xref:rgant.adoc#_rgant-DomainServiceLayout_menuOrder[`@DomainServiceLayout#menuOrder()`] (as explained
in the xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_intro_overriding-the-services[introduction] to this guide).



== Related Services

This service is used when invoking an action, the memento being copied onto the `Command`.
If the action turns out to be published, then the memento is copied down from the `Command`
 and may be used by the xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_spi_PublishingService[`PublishingService`] implementation.

In addition, the service is also called by xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_api_BackgroundService[`BackgroundService`] in order to create a memento
for a command that can then be run in the background at some time in the future.
