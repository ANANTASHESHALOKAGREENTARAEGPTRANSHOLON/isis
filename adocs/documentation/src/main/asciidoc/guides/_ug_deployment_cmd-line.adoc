== `WebServer` class

The `org.apache.isis.WebServer` utility class provides a `main(String[])` method so that an Apache Isis application can be run from within the IDE or command line, without the need to package the app as a WAR file and deploying to a servlet container.  Internally the class it uses jetty to programmatically bootstrap the app.

The utility class also supports a number of command line arguments:
