The `semantics()` attribute describes whether the invocation is safe (as no side-effects), is idempotent (may have side-effects but always has the same post-conditions), or is neither safe nor idempotent. If the annotation is missing then the framework assumes non-idempotent.

[TIP]
====
The attribute was originally introduced for the xref:ug.adoc#_ug_restfulobjects-viewer[RestfulObjects viewer] in order that action invocations could be made available using either HTTP GET, PUT or POST (respectively).

Since then its use has been extended into the core runtime.  For example, it is now aso used for the in-built concurrency checking; the invocation of a safe action does not perform a concurrency check, whereas non-safe actions do perform a concurrency check.

For example:

[source,java]
----
public class Customer {
    @Action(semantics=SemanticsOf.SAFE)
    public CreditRating checkCredit() { ... }

    @Action(semantics=SemanticsOf.IDEMPOTENT)
    public void changeOfAddress(Address address) { ... }

    @Action(semantics=SemanticsOf.NON_IDEMPOTENT)
    public Order placeNewOrder() { ... }
    ...
}
