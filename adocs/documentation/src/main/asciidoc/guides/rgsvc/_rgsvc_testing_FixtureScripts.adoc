The `FixtureScripts` service provides the ability to execute xref:../ugtst/ugtst.adoc#_ugtst_fixture-scripts_api-and-usage[fixture scripts] .

The default implementation of this service, `FixtureScriptsDefault`, uses the associated xref:../rgsvc/rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_testing_FixtureScriptsSpecificationProvider[`FixtureScriptsSpecificationProvider`] to obtain a `FixtureScriptsSpecification`.
This configures this service, for example telling it which package to search for `FixtureScript` classes, how to execute those classes, and hints that influence the UI.



== API & Implementation

The API for the service is:

[source,java]
----
public abstract class FixtureScripts ... {
    @Programmatic
    public List<FixtureResult> runFixtureScript(
        FixtureScript fixtureScript,
        String parameters) { ... }
}
----

The implementation is `o.a.i.applib.services.fixturespec.FixtureScriptsDefault`




== Related Services

The service interacts with xref:../rgsvc/rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_testing_FixtureScriptsSpecificationProvider[`FixtureScriptsSpecificationProvider`].
