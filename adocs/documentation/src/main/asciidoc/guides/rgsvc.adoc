[[_rgsvc]]
== Domain Services

This guide documents Apache Isis' domain services, both those that act as an xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc-api[API]
(implemented by the framework for your domain objects to call), and those domain services that act as an
xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc-spi[SPI] (implemented by your domain application and which are called by the framework).
