The ruby script, `monitor.rb` emulates the `mvn compile` command, regenerating any changed Asciidoctor files to the relevant `target/site` directory.  Moreover if any included files are changed then it rebuilds the parent (per the above naming convention).

== One-time setup

To setup:

* download and install ruby 2.0.0, from link:rubyinstaller.org/downloads[http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/]
* download devkit for the Ruby 2.0 installation, also from link:rubyinstaller.org/downloads[http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/]. Then follow the link:https://github.com/oneclick/rubyinstaller/wiki/Development-Kit[installation instructions] on their wiki


[NOTE]
====
We use Ruby 2.0 rather than 2.1 because the wdm gem (required to monitor the filesystem if running on Windows) is not currently compatible with Ruby 2.1.
====

To download the required Ruby dependencies, use:

[source,bash]
----
gem install bundler
bundle install
----

== Instant Rebuild

To run, we typically just use:

[source,bash]
----
sh monitor.sh
----

This script simply runs `mvn clean compile && ruby monitor.rb -b`.  The `mvn` command performs a clean rebuild of the site, and then the ruby script monitors for any further changes under `src/main/asciidoc`.

The script also starts up a web server on port 4000 so you can review results.  If any `.adoc` changes, then the appropriate HTML will be regenerated.  And, if any new assets (CSS, images etc) are added, they will be copied across.  The `-b` flag passed through means that the script also starts a web browser pointing at the newly generated docs.

The `monitor.rb` script has a couple of other options, use `-h` flag for usage:

[source,bash]
----
ruby monitor.rb -h
----

which should print:

[source]
----
usage: monitor.rb [options]
    -p, --port       port (default: 4000)
    -b, --browser    launch browser
    -h, --help       help
----
