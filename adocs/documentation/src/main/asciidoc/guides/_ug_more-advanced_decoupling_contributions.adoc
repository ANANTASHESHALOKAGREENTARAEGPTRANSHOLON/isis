Contributed services provide many of the same benefits as xref:ug.adoc#_ug_more-advanced_decoupling_mixins[mixins];
indeed mixins (`1.10.0-SNAPSHOT`) are an evolution and refinement of the contributions concept.

The main difference between contributed services and mixins is that the actions of a contributed service will
contribute to _all_ the parameters of its actions, whereas a mixin only contributes to the type accepted in its
constructor.  Also, contributed services are long-lived
singletons, whereas mixins are instantiated as required (by the framework) and then discarded almost immediately.

For more on contributed services:

* the syntax of writing contributed actions/properties/collections is described in this xref:ug.adoc#_ug_how-tos_contributed-members[how-to]

* there's also useful information in the reference guide, discussing the xref:rg.adoc#_rg_annotations_manpage-DomainService_nature[@DomainService#nature()] attribute, for the `NatureOfService.VIEW_CONTRIBUTIONS_ONLY` nature.
