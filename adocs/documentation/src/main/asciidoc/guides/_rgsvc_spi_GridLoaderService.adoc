The `GridLoaderService` provides the ability to load the XML layout (grid) for a domain class.

== SPI

The SPI defined by this service is:

[source,java]
----
public interface GridLoaderService {
    boolean existsFor(Class<?> domainClass);    // <1>
    Grid load(final Class<?> domainClass);      // <2>
}
----
<1> whether any persisted layout metadata (eg a `.layout.xml` file) exists for this domain class.
<2> returns a new instance of a xref:rgcms.adoc#_rgcms_classes_layout_component[`Grid`] for the specified domain class, eg as loaded from a `layout.xml` file.  If none exists, will return null (and the calling xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_spi_GridService[`GridService`] will use xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_spi_GridSystemService[`GridSystemService`] to obtain a default grid for the domain class).
