All domain entities automatically implement the DataNucleus `Persistable` role interface as a result of the enhancer
process (the fully qualified class name is `org.datanucleus.enhancement.Persistable`).  So as a developer you do not
need to write any code for this role interface.

Nevertheless, the `Persistable_downloadJdoMetadata` mixin (`1.11.0-SNAPSHOT`) provides the ability to download the
JDO link:http://www.datanucleus.org/products/datanucleus/jdo/metadata_xml.html[class metadata in XML] form.  The mixin
defines the following action:

[source,java]
----
@Mixin
public class Persistable_downloadJdoMetadata {
    public Persistable_downloadJdoMetadata(final Persistable persistable) { ... }   // <1>
    public Object downloadJdoMetadata(final String fileName) { ... }                // <2>
    ...
}
----
<1> provided as an action to any domain entity
<2> actually this is '$$' in the code, a "special case" that means to use the derive the action name from the class name.

This will return the XML text wrapped up in a xref:rg.adoc#_rg_classes_value-types_manpage-Clob[`Clob`].

The mixin delegates to the xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc-api_IsisJdoSupport[`IsisJdoSupport`] service to obtain
a reference to the JDO `PersistenceManagerFactory`.
