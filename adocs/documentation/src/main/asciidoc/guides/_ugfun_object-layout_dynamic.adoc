Metadata providing UI hints can be specified either statically, using annotations, or dynamically, using a `.layout.json` file.  This section describes the dynamic approach, using the file.


== JSON layout file

The JSON layout file for class `Xxx` takes the name `Xxx.layout.json`, and resides in the same package as the class.
The format of the file is:

[source,javascript]
----
{
  "columns": [                                // list of columns
    {
      "span": 6,                              // span of the left-hand property column
      "memberGroups": {                       // ordered map of member (property) groups
        "General": {                          // member group name
          "members": {

              "propertyLayout": {
                "typicalLength": 50           // UI hint for size of field (no longer used in ISIS 1.8.0)

----

Although advisable, it is not necessary to list all class members in this file. Any members not listed with be
ordered according either to annotations (if present) or fallback/default values.

Note also that the layout file may contain entries for xref:ugfun.adoc#_ugfun_how-tos_contributed-members[contributed associations and actions]; this allows each contributee classes to define their own layout for their contributions, possibly overriding any static metadata on the original domain service contributor.



== Downloading an initial layout

The fastest way to get started is to use the (non-ASF) link:http://github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-devutils[Isis addons' devutils] module to download the layout file (derived from any existing static metadata defined by annotations).
