The `publishing()` attribute determines whether and how an action invocation is published via the registered implementation of a xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc-spi_PublishingService[`PublishingService`]).  This attribute is also supported for xref:rgant.adoc#_rgant-DomainObject_publishing[domain objects], where it controls whether changed objects are published as events.

A common use case is to notify external "downstream" systems of changes in the state of the Isis application.
The default value for the attribute is `AS_CONFIGURED`, meaning that the xref:rg.adoc#_rg_runtime_configuring-core[configuration property] `isis.services.publish.actions` is used to determine the whether the action is published:

* `all` +
+
all actions are published

* `ignoreSafe` (or `ignoreQueryOnly`) +
+
actions with safe (read-only) semantics are ignored, but actions which may modify data are not ignored

* `none` +
+
no actions are published

If there is no configuration property in `isis.properties` then publishing is automatically enabled.

This default can be overridden on an action-by-action basis; if `publishing()` is set to `ENABLED` then the action invocation is published irrespective of the configured value; if set to `DISABLED` then the action invocation is _not_ published, again irrespective of the configured value.

For example:

[source,java]
----
public class Order {
    @Action(publishing=Publishing.ENABLED)        // <1>
    public Invoice generateInvoice(...) { ... }
}
----
<1> because set to enabled, will be published irrespective of the configured value.




== `publishingPayloadFactory()`

The (optional) related `publishingPayloadFactory()` specifies the class to use to create the (payload of the) event to be published by the publishing factory.

Rather than simply broadcast that the action was invoked, the payload factory allows a "fatter" payload to be instantiated that can eagerly push commonly-required information to all subscribers. For at least some subscribers this should avoid the necessity to query back for additional information.
