The representations specified by the http://restfulobjects.org[Restful Object spec] are very rich in hypermedia
controls and metadata, intended to support a wide variety of possible REST clients.

As described xref:ug.adoc#_ug_restfulobjects-viewer_configuration-properties_suppressing-elements[above], it is possible to suppress various elements of these representations. Even then, though, the representations may be too complex for some bespoke REST clients that require a very "flat" object representation.

The Restful Objects viewer therefore supports generating a much simpler representation of objects using the following configuration property (typically added to `WEB-INF/viewer_restfulobjects.properties`):

[source,ini]
----
isis.viewer.restfulobjects.objectPropertyValuesOnly=true
----

This generates a representation such as:

[source,javascript]
----
{
    "title" : "Buy milk due by 2014-10-27",
    "domainType" : "TODO",
    "instanceId" : "0",
    "members" : {
        "description" : "Buy milk",
        "category" : "Domestic",
        "subcategory" : "Shopping",
        "complete" : false,
        "versionSequence" : 1,
        "relativePriority" : 2,
        "dueBy" : "2014-10-27",
        "cost" : "0.75",
        "notes" : null,
        "attachment" : null,
        "doc" : null
    },
    "links" : [
        {
            "rel" : "self",
            "href" : "http://localhost:8080/restful/objects/TODO/0",
            "method" : "GET",
            "type" : "application/json;profile=\"urn:org.restfulobjects:repr-types/object\"",
            "title" : "Buy milk due by 2014-10-27"
        },
        {
            "rel" : "describedby",
            "href" : "http://localhost:8080/restful/domain-types/TODO",
            "method" : "GET",
            "type" : "application/json;profile=\"urn:org.restfulobjects:repr-types/domain-type\""
        }
    ],
    "extensions" : {
        "oid" : "TODO:0"
    },
}

[NOTE]
====
In the future we might extend this per-request.  Raise/vote on a JIRA ticket if you require this feature.

If the above isn't flexible and you need complete control over all representations see the section on xref:ug.adoc#_ug_extending_restfulobjects-viewer[Extending the Restful Objects viewer].
