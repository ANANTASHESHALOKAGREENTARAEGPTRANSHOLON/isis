The `ClassDiscovery` service is used to automatically discover subclasses of any given type on the classpath.  The primary use case is to support "convention-over-configuration" designs that work with a minimum of configuration.

This service is used by the xref:rg.adoc#_rg_classes_super_manpage-FixtureScripts[`FixtureScripts`] service to automatically locate any xref:rg.adoc#_rg_classes_super_manpage-FixtureScript[`FixtureScript`] implementations.



== SPI

The SPI defined by the service is:

[source,java]
----
public interface ClassDiscoveryService2  {
    @Programmatic
    <T> Set<Class<? extends T>> findSubTypesOfClasses(Class<T> type, String packagePrefix);
    @Deprecated
    @Programmatic
    <T> Set<Class<? extends T>> findSubTypesOfClasses(Class<T> type);       // <1>
}
----
<1> no longer used



== Implementation

Isis provides an implementation of this service, namely `o.a.i.applib.services.classdiscovery.ClassDiscoveryServiceUsingReflections`.

[NOTE]
====
This implementation is also used to discover domain services annotated with xref:rg.adoc#_rg_annotations_manpage-DomainService[`@DomainService`].  Currently this logic uses the implementation directly, so is not pluggable.  However, the entire `ServicesInstaller`
====



== Usage

The usage will vary depending upon the conventions of the design.  In the case of fixture scripts, the convention is to implement scripts by subclassing xref:rg.adoc#_rg_classes_super_manpage-FixtureScript[`FixtureScript`], and to specify the package prefix in the constructor for xref:rg.adoc#_rg_classes_super_manpage-FixtureScripts[`FixtureScripts`].

For example, the (non-ASF) http://github.com/isisaddons/isis-app-todoapp[Isis addons' todoapp] has its fixture scripts in the `todoapp.fixture` package.  the `ToDoAppFixturesService` (its subclass of xref:rg.adoc#_rg_classes_super_manpage-FixtureScripts[`FixtureScripts`] is in the same package, so its constructor is:

[source,java]
----
package todoapp.fixture;
...
@DomainService(nature = NatureOfService.VIEW_MENU_ONLY)
public class ToDoAppFixturesService extends FixtureScripts {
    public ToDoAppFixturesService() {
        super(
                ToDoAppFixturesService.class.getPackage().getName(),    // <1>
                MultipleExecutionStrategy.EXECUTE);
    }
    ...
}
----
<1> specify the package prefix to search under for fixture scripts

Other designs using this service are likely to work in a similar way, requiring some sort of scope to be specified.


== Registering the Services

Assuming that the `configuration-and-annotation` services installer is configured:

[source,ini]
----
isis.services-installer=configuration-and-annotation
----

then Isis' core implementation of `ClassDiscoveryService2` service is automatically registered and injected (it is annotated with `@DomainService`) so no further configuration is required.
