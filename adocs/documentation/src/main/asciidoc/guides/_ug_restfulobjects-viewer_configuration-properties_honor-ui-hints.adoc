By default the representations generated by Restful Objects ignore any Apache Isis metamodel hints referring to the UI.
In particular, if a collection is annotated then `Render(EAGERLY)` then the contents of the collection are _not_
eagerly embedded in the object representation.

However, this behaviour can be overridden globally using following property (typically added to `WEB-INF/viewer_restfulobjects.properties`):

isis.viewer.restfulobjects.honorUiHints=true

In the future we might extend this per-request.  Raise/vote on a JIRA ticket if you require this feature.
