== Testing

If you are going to use Apache Isis for developing complex business-critical applications, then being able to write
automated tests for those applications becomes massively important.  As such Apache Isis treats the topic of testing
very seriously.  (Though we say it ourselves), the framework has support that goes way above what is provided by other
application frameworks.

This guide describes those features available to you for testing your Apache Isis application.
