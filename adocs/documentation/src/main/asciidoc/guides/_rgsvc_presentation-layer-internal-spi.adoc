Domain service SPIs for the presentation layer influence how the Apache Isis viewers behave.  In addition to those defined in the applib, the framework also defines a small number of services that use classes that are internal to the framework.

[WARNING]
====
We do not guarantee that link:http://semver.org[semantic versioning] will be honoured for these ASPIs.

The table below summarizes the presentation layer non-public SPIs defined by Apache Isis.  It also lists their corresponding implementation, either a default implementation provided by Apache Isis itself, or provided by one of the in (non-ASF) link:http://www.isisaddons.org[Isis Addons] modules.
