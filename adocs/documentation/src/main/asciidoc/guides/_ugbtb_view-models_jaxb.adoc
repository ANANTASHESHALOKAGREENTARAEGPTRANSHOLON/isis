This section provides some recommended practices if using JAXB and `@XmlRootElement` to define domain models.  The
examples are taken from the (non-ASF) http://github.com/isisaddons/isis-app-todoapp[Isis addons' todoapp].



[[_ugbtb_view-models_jaxb_using-packages-to-version]]
== Use packages to version DTOs

The whole point of using DTOs (in Apache Isis, at least) is to define a formal contact between two interoperating but
independent applications.  Since the only thing we can predicate about the future with any certainty is that it one or
both of these applications will change, we should version DTOs from the get-go.

With XML every element may be defined as belonging to a particular namespace; in JAXB this translates to Java packages.
We therefore should place each DTO within its own package, and that package should include a version identifier.

For example, the http://github.com/isisaddons/isis-app-todoapp[Isis addons' todoapp] defines this DTO (as a versioned
representation of its underlying `ToDoItem` entity):

[source,java]
----
@XmlRootElement(name = "toDoItemDto")                               // <1>
@XmlType(
        propOrder = {                                               // <2>
            "description",
            "category",
            "subcategory",
            "cost"
        }
)
@DomainObjectLayout(
        titleUiEvent = TitleUiEvent.Doop.class                      // <3>
)
public class ToDoItemDto implements Dto {
    @XmlElement(required = true)
    @Getter @Setter                                                 // <4>
    protected String description;

    @XmlElement(required = true)
    @Getter @Setter
    protected String category;

    @Getter @Setter
    protected String subcategory;

    @Getter @Setter
    protected BigDecimal cost;
}
----
<1> identifies this class as a view model and defines the root element for JAXB serialization
<2> all properties in the class must be listed; (they can be ignored using `@XmlTransient`)
<3> demonstrating use of UI events for a subscriber to provide the DTO's title; see xref:rgant.adoc#_rgant-DomainObjectLayout_titleUiEvent[`@DomainObjectLayout#titleUiEvent()`].
<4> optional; JAXB metadata can specify such attributes as required/optional


For the package in which the DTO class resides, we define a corresponding namespace.  This goes in `package-info.java`:

[source,java]
----
@javax.xml.bind.annotation.XmlSchema(
        namespace = "http://viewmodels.app.todoapp/todoitem/v1_0/todoitem.xsd", // <1>
        elementFormDefault = javax.xml.bind.annotation.XmlNsForm.QUALIFIED
)
package todoapp.app.viewmodels.todoitem.v1_0;                                   // <2>
----
<1> the namespace URI, used by the DTO residing in this package.  There is no requirement for this to correspond to a physical URL, but it should be unique (this
usually implies the usage of a company domain name).
<2> the package in which the DTO resides.

Note how both the XML namespace and package are broadly equivalent to each other; in particular note that they both
also include a version "v1_0".




[[_ugbtb_view-models_jaxb_semantic-versioning]]
== Semantic Versioning

Versioning DTOs enables us to make changes without breaking existing consumers of the data.  We can distinguish two
types of changes:

* backwardly compatible changes
* breaking changes.

Following link:http://semver.org[semantic versioning] approach, we suggest using `v1_0`, `v1_1`, `v1_2` etc as the
package version for a sequence of backwardly compatible changes, then bump up to `v2_0` for a breaking change.

Backwardly compatible changes can generally (always?) be modelled using class inheritance.  Thus, `v1_1.ToDoItemDto`
is a subclass of `v1_0.ToDoItemDto`.  This makes sense too: OO inheritance means "is-substitutable-for", so what is
true in an OO context is true when processing XML documents.

On the other hand, breaking changes probably (always?) imply that the next version of the DTO does not use inheritance.
Thus `v2_0.ToDoItemDto` might share many of the same properties as the `v1_1.ToDoItemDto`, but any reuse would be
copy-n-paste rather than through inheritance.

To see this in practice, here's (the outline of) v1.1 of `ToDoItemDto`:

[source,java]
----
package todoapp.app.viewmodels.todoitem.v1_1;
...
@XmlRootElement(name = "toDoItemDto")
@XmlType(
        propOrder = {
                "toDoItem",
                "similarItems"
        }
)
public class ToDoItemDto extends todoapp.app.viewmodels.todoitem.v1_0.ToDoItemDto {
    ...
}
----


The corresponding `package-info.java` is similar to that for `v1_0`, though note how it also defines a namespace prefix
for `v1_0`:

[source,java]
----
@javax.xml.bind.annotation.XmlSchema(
        namespace = "http://viewmodels.app.todoapp/todoitem/v1_1/todoitem.xsd",         <!--1-->
        xmlns = {
                @javax.xml.bind.annotation.XmlNs(                                       <!--2-->
                        namespaceURI = "http://isis.apache.org/schema/common",
                        prefix = "common"
                ),
                @javax.xml.bind.annotation.XmlNs(
                        namespaceURI = "http://viewmodels.app.todoapp/todoitem/v1_0/todoitem.xsd",
                        prefix = "todoitem-v1_0"
                )
        },
        elementFormDefault = javax.xml.bind.annotation.XmlNsForm.QUALIFIED
)
package todoapp.app.viewmodels.todoitem.v1_1;
----
<1> namespace URI for DTO in this class.
<2> aliases for any other namespaces referenced.



[[_ugbtb_view-models_jaxb_referencing-domain-entities]]
== Referencing Domain Entities

It's quite common for view models to be "backed by" (be projections of) some underlying domain entity.  The
`ToDoItemDto` we've been using as the example in this section is an example: there is an underlying `ToDoItem` entity.

It wouldn't make sense to serialize out the state of a persistent entity: the point of a DTO is to act as a facade
on top of the entity so that the implementation details (of the entity's structure) don't leak out to the consumer.
However, the identity of the underlying entity can be well defined; Apache Isis defines the
xref:rgcms.adoc#_rgcms_schema-common[Common schema] which defines the `<oid-dto>` element (and corresponding `OidDto` class):
the object's type and its identifier.  This is basically a formal XML equivalent to the `Bookmark` object obtained
from the xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_api_BookmarkService[`BookmarkService`].

There is only one requirement to make this work: every referenced domain entity must be annotated with
xref:rgant.adoc#_rgant-XmlJavaTypeAdapter[`@XmlJavaTypeAdapter`], specifying the framework-provided
`PersistentEntityAdapter.class`.  This class is similar to the `BookmarkService`: it knows how to create an `OidDto`
from an object reference.

Thus, in our view model we can legitimately write:

[source,java]
----
package todoapp.app.viewmodels.todoitem.v1_1;
...
public class ToDoItemDto extends todoapp.app.viewmodels.todoitem.v1_0.ToDoItemDto {
    ...
    @Getter @Setter
    protected ToDoItem toDoItem;
}
----

All we need to do is remember to add that `@XmlJavaTypeAdapter` annotation to the referenced entity:

[source,java]
----
@XmlJavaTypeAdapter(PersistentEntityAdapter.class)
public class ToDoItem ...  {
    ...
}
----



[[_ugbtb_view-models_jaxb_collections]]
== Collections

It's also possible for a DTO to hold collections of objects.  These can be of any type, either simple properties, or
references to other objects.

The only bit of boilerplate that is required is the `@XmlElementWrapper` annotation.  This instructs JAXB to create
an XML element (based on the field name) to contain each of the elements.  (If this is omitted then the contents of
the collection are at the same level as the properties; almost certainly not what is required).

For example, the v1.1 of the `ToDoItemDto` could also contain:

[source,java]
----
package todoapp.app.viewmodels.todoitem.v1_1;
...
public class ToDoItemDto extends todoapp.app.viewmodels.todoitem.v1_0.ToDoItemDto {
    ...
    @XmlElementWrapper
    @XmlElement(name = "todoItem")
    @Getter @Setter
    protected List<ToDoItem> similarItems = Lists.newArrayList();
}
----


There's nothing to prevent a JAXB DTO from containing rich graphs of data, parent containing children containing
children.  Be aware though that all of this state will become the DTO's memento, ultimately converted into a URL-safe
form, by way of the xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_spi_UrlEncodingService[`UrlEncodingService`].

There are limits to the lengths of URLs, however.  Therefore the DTO should not include state that can easily be
derived from other information.  If the URL does exceed limits, then provide a custom implementation of `UrlEncodingService`
to handle the memento string in some other fashion (eg substituting it with a GUID, with the memento cached somehow
on the server).





== Generating XSDs and DTOs

The xref:cg.adoc#_cg_isis-maven-plugin[Apache Isis maven plugin] provides the xref:cg.adoc#_cg_isis-maven-plugin_xsd[xsd] goal that allows the XSDs to be generated from any JAXB-annotated view models.
These use the xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_api_JaxbService[`JaxbService`] to generate the schemas; using the
standard `schemagen` command line will not correctly interpret any references to domain entities as OIDs.

The documentation for the `xsd` goal also explains how to generate DTO classes from the generated XSDs.  Note that these
DTOs are not the same as the JAXB view models; they can be used outside of an Isis application, for example in a
standalone subscriber running on an enterprise service bus such as Apache Camel.
