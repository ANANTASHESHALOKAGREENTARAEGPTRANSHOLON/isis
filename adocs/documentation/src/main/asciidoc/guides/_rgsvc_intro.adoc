[[_rgsvc_intro_types-of-domain-services]]
== Types of Domain Service

The domain services also group into various broad categories.  Many support functionality of the various layers of the
system (presentation layer, application layer, core domain, persistence layer); others exist to allow the domain objects
to integrate with other bounded contexts, or provide various metadata (eg for development-time tooling).  The diagram below shows these categories:

image::{_imagesdir}reference-services/categories.png[width="600px",link="{_imagesdir}reference-services/categories.png"]


A small number of domain services can be considered both API and SPI; a good example is the xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_api_EmailService[`EmailService`] that is of direct use for domain objects wishing to send out emails,
but is also used by the framework to support the xref:ugvw.adoc#_ugvw_features_user-registration[user registration] functionality supported by the xref:ugvw.adoc#[Wicket viewer].   The same is true of the xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_api_EventBusService[`EventBusService`]; this can be used by domain objects to broadcast arbitrary events, but is also used by the framework to automatically emit events for xref:rgant.adoc#_rgant-Action_domainEvent[`@Action#domainEvent()`] etc.

For these hybrid services we have categorized the service as an "API" service.  This chapter therefore contains only the strictly SPI services.

This rest of this guide is broken out into several chapters, one for each of the various types/categories of domain service.



[[_rgsvc_intro_public-api]]
== Public API

The vast majority of Apache Isis' domain services are defined in Apache Isis' applib (`o.a.i.core:isis-core-applib`
module) as stable, public classes.  Importantly, this also minimizes the coupling between your code and Apache Isis,
allowing you to easily mock out these services in your unit tests.




[[_rgsvc_intro_using-the-services]]
== Using the services

Apache Isis includes an extensive number of domain services for your domain objects to use; simply define the service as an annotated field and Apache Isis will inject the service into your object.

For example:

[source,java]
----
public class Customer {

    public void sendEmail( String subject, String body) {
        List<String> cc = Collections.emptyList;
        List<String> bcc = Collections.emptyList;
        emailService.send(getEmailAddress(), cc, bcc, subject, body);
    }
    public boolean hideSendEmail() {
        return !emailService.isConfigured();
    }

    @Inject                                                            // <1>
    EmailService emailService;
}
----
<1> Service automatically injected by the framework.

For objects that are already persisted, the service is automatically injected just after the object is rehydrated by
JDO/DataNucleus.

For transient objects (instantiated programmatically), the (in `1.12.0-SNAPSHOT`)
xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_api_FactoryService[`FactoryService`]'s ``instantiate()`` method (or the deprecated
xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_api_DomainObjectContainer[`DomainObjectContainer`]'s ``newTransientInstance()`` method)
will automatically inject the services.

Alternatively the object can be instantiated simply using `new`, then services injected using (`1.12.0-SNAPSHOT)
xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_api_ServiceRegistry[`ServiceRegistry`]'s ``injectServicesInto(...)`` method (or the deprecated
xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_api_DomainObjectContainer[`DomainObjectContainer`]'s ``injectServicesInto(...)`` method).




[[_rgsvc_intro_overriding-the-services]]
== Overriding the services

The framework provides default implementations for many of the domain services.  This is convenient, but sometimes you will want to replace the default implementation with your own service implementation.

The trick is to use the xref:rgant.adoc#_rgant-DomainServiceLayout_menuOrder[`@DomainServiceLayout#menuOrder()`] attribute, specifying a low number (typically `"1"`).

[NOTE]
====
For a small number of domain services, all implementations are used (following the chain-of-responsibility pattern), not just the first one.  The services in question are: xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_spi_ContentMappingService[`ContentMappingService`], xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_spi_GridSystemService[`GridSystemService`] (`1.12.0-SNAPSHOT`), and xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_spi_RoutingService[`RoutingService`].
====

For example, suppose you wanted to provide your own implementation of xref:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_api_LocaleProvider[`LocaleProvider`].  Here's how:

[source,java]
----
@DomainService(
        nature = NatureOfService.DOMAIN
)
@DomainServiceLayout(
        menuOrder = "1"                             // <1>
)
public class MyLocaleProvider implements LocaleProvider {
    @Override
    public Locale getLocale() {
        return ...
    }
}
----
<1> takes precedence over the default implementation.


It's also quite common to want to decorate the existing implementation (ie have your own implementation delegate to the default); this is also possible and quite easy (if using `1.10.0` or later).  The idea is to have the framework inject all implementations of the service, and then to delegate to the first one that isn't "this" one:

[source,java]
----
@DomainService(nature=NatureOfService.DOMAIN)
@DomainServiceLayout(
        menuOrder = "1"                                                                 // <1>
)
public class MyLocaleProvider implements LocaleProvider {
    @Override
    public Locale getLocale() {
        return getDelegateLocaleProvider().getLocale();                                 // <2>
    }
    private LocaleProvider getDelegateLocaleProvider() {
        return Iterables.tryFind(localeProviders, input -> input != this).orNull();     // <3>
    }
    @Inject
    List<LocaleProvider> localeProviders;                                               // <4>
}
----
<1> takes precedence over the default implementation when injected elsewhere.
<2> this implementation merely delegates to the default implementation
<3> find the first implementation that isn't _this_ implementation (else infinite loop!)
<4> injects all implementations, including this implemenation

The above code could be improved by caching the delegateLocaleProvider once located (rather than searching each time).
