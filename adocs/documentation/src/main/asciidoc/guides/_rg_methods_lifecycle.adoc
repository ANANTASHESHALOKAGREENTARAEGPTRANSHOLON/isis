The lifecycle callback methods notify a domain entity about its interaction within the persistence lifecycle.  For example, the entity is notified immediately prior to being persisted, or when it is about to be updated.

[WARNING]
====
Note that these callbacks are fired by Apache Isis rather than JDO.  In the future we may deprecate them because there are better mechanisms available using listeners/subscribers:

* in Isis 1.9.0 and earlier, you may therefore want to consider using the JDO API directly to set up a lifecycle
listener; see xref:rg.adoc#_rg_methods_lifecycle_jdo-api[here] for further discussion.

* alternatively, you can use a subscriber for the xref:rg.adoc#_rg_classes_lifecycleevent[lifecycle event]s fired in Isis.

The lifecycle callback methods supported by Isis are:
