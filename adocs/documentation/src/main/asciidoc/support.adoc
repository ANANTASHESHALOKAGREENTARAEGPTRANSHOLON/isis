The Markmail archives span both our current (TLP) mailing lists and also our original mailing lists while in the Apache incubator; the ASF archives span just our TLP mailing lists.



[[how-to-subscribe]
== How to subscribe

To subscribe to the `users` mailing list:

* send a blank email to link:mailto:users-subscribe@isis.apache.org[users-subscribe@isis.apache.org]
* You'll then get back a confirmation email.
* To confirm, all you generally need to do is to send a blank reply (there are more detailed instructions inside that confirmation mail if that doesn't work)

Then, to ask questions, simply mail to link:mailto:users@isis.apache.org[users@isis.apache.org] (nb: no `-subscribe` suffix this time). 

If you ever want to unsubscribe, then you can send a mail to the `users-unsubscribe` email address.


== Mailing list etiquette

Just a couple of rules/suggestions:

* if you are referencing links, then in the body of the mail, number then [1], [2], [3] etc and then list them at the end.  Here's a [good example]() from the archives.
* reply to a previous post in the link:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posting_style#Interleaved_style[interleaved style] (adding your replies in-line).  Try not to link:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posting_style#Top-posting)[top-post].
