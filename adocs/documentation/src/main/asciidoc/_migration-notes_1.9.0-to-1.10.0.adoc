issues here.



== `allowLateRegistration`

One possible issue is that (as per link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ISIS-830[ISIS-830]) the xref:rg.adoc#_rg_services-api_manpage-EventBusService[`EventBusService`] is now initialized as one of the first domain
services; this is to ensure that any object lifecycle events caused by domain services initializing themselves can be
posted on the event bus for subscribers.  The typical case for such lifecycle events to occur is from domain services
that seed reference data; one such example can be found in the (non-ASF)
 http://github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-security[Isis addons' security] module.

In previous releases, the ordering of initialization for the `EventBusService` was undefined (but would typically be towards the
"end" of the list of services.  What this meant in practice is that it generally didn't matter whether (domain service)
subscribers were initialized before or after seed services.

Now, though, because the `EventBusService` is initialized early on, it proactively checks that all subscribers have
been registered before any event posts occur (so that no events get missed).  If any subscriber attempts to register
after at least one event has been posted, then the service will fail fast and the framework will not start.  The error looks something like:

[source,log]

To ensure that subscriber domain services are initialized before "seed" domain services, the xref:rg.adoc#_rg_annotations_manpage-DomainServiceLayout_menuOrder[`@DomainServiceLayout#menuOrder()`] attribute can be used.
Normally this attribute is just used to order UI-visible services on the menu bars, but it also is used
internally to sequence the internal list of services being initialized.

Alternatively, you can disable this checking within the `EventBusService` using:

[source,ini]
----
isis.services.eventbus.allowLateRegistration=false
----

If you do that, be aware that not all subscribers may not receive some events generated by other domain services.

For more details, see the xref:rg.adoc#_rg_services-api_manpage-EventBusService[`EventBusService`] man page.
