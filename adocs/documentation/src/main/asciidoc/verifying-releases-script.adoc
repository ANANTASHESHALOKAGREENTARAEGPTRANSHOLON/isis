To save some time in verifying an Isis release we've assembled a script to automate the process. The script is tested on Mac OSX and Linux. Windows users can use Cygwin or http://msysgit.github.io/[msysgit].

It's _recommended_ that you start this process in an empty directory:

[source,bash]
----
mkdir ~/verify-isis-release
cd ~/verify-isis-release
----




== Copy the script to your local machine

The script could be enhanced in many ways, feel free to do so! Copy (or link:resources/release-process/verify-isis-release.sh[download]) the `verify-isis-release.sh` script below:

[source,bash]
----
#!/bin/bash
# Instructions:
# -Create an empty directory
# -Put a .txt file in it containing a list of all the urls of the zip files
# -Run this script
# TODO: enhance this script so it will stop when something is broken
_download(){
    for fil in `cat *.txt`
    do
       echo 'Downloading '$fil
       curl  -L -O $fil
       curl  -L -O $fil.asc
    done
}
_verify(){
    for zip in *.zip
    do 
       echo 'Verifying '$zip 
       gpg --verify $zip.asc $zip 
    done
}
_unpack(){
    echo 'Unpacking '
    unzip -q '*.zip'
}
_build(){
    echo 'Removing Isis from local repo '$module
    rm -rf ~/.m2/repository/org/apache/isis
    COUNTER=0
    for module in ./*/
    do
       COUNTER=$[COUNTER+1]
       if [ $COUNTER -eq 1 ]
       then
         cd $module
         echo 'Building Core '$module
         mvn clean install -o
         cd ..
       else
         cd $module
         echo 'Building Module '$module
         mvn clean install
         cd ..
       fi
    done
}
# The work starts here 
_download
_verify
_unpack
_build
----

Make sure the script is executable:

[source]
----
chmod +x verify-isis-release.sh
----




== Create an input file

The input file is a plain `.txt` file containing all urls to the packages to be verified. Here's a sample of the release of Isis 1.8.0:

[source]
----
https://repository.apache.org/content/repositories/orgapacheisis-063/org/apache/isis/core/isis/1.8.0/isis-1.8.0-source-release.zip
https://repository.apache.org/content/repositories/orgapacheisis-065/org/apache/isis/archetype/simpleapp-archetype/1.8.0/simpleapp-archetype-1.8.0-source-release.zip
----

The actual list of packages to be verified will be provided through the mailing list.




== Clean out Isis from your local Maven repo

[source,bash]
----
rm -rf ~/.m2/repository/org/apache/isis
----



== Execute the script

Execute...

[source,bash]
----
./verify-isis-release.sh
----

â€¦and get yourself a cup of coffee.




== Test the archetype

Assuming that everything builds ok, then test the archetypes (adjust version as necessary):

[source,bash]
----
mvn archetype:generate  \
    -D archetypeGroupId=org.apache.isis.archetype \
    -D archetypeArtifactId=simpleapp-archetype \
    -D groupId=com.mycompany \
    -D artifactId=myapp \
    -D version=1.0-SNAPSHOT \
    -B \
    -o \
    -D archetypeVersion=1.8.0   # adjust version as necessary

cd myapp
mvn clean install -o
mvn -P self-host antrun:run
----

If it runs up ok, then it's time to link:verifying-releases.html[vote]!
