This release is primarily a bug fix release, but does introduce a couple of notable new features and improvements:

* link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ISIS-1585[ISIS-1585] supports checkboxes on parented (rather than standalone) collections.
The selected items are used as the default values for any associated actions with collection parameters.
+
As part of this change, the new `@Action(associateWith="...")` attribute can be used instead of `@MemberOrder(...)` as a way to associate actions with either collections or properties.

* link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ISIS-1569[ISIS-1569] provides infrastructure to enable commands to be replayed from master to slave (for regression testing purposes).

+
The majority of the implementation is provided in the (non-ASF) (non-ASF) link:http://platform.incode.org[Incode Platform]'s new link:http://platform.incode.org/modules/spi/command/spi-command-replay.html[command replay] library.

Applications written against v1.16.0 should run against v1.16.1 with few if any changes.
