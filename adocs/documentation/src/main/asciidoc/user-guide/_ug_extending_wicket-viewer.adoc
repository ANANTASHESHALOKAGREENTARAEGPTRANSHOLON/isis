The Wicket viewer allows you to customize the GUI in several (progressively more sophisticated) ways:

* by <<_tweak_the_ui_with_css, tweaking the UI using CSS>>
* by <<_tweak_the_ui_with_javascript, tweaking the UI using Javascript>>
* by writing a <<_writing_a_custom_theme, custom bootstrap theme>>
* by <<_replacing_page_elements, replacing elements of the page>> using the `ComponentFactory` interface
* by implementing <<_custom_pages, replacement page implementations>> for the standard page types

The first two of these options are discussed in the <<Wicket Viewer>> chapter.  This chapter describes the remaining "heavier-weight/more powerful" options.
