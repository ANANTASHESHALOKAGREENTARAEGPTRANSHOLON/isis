## Singleton & request-scoped services

IMPORTANT: TODO


It's worth extending the <<_hexagonal_architecture, Hexagonal Architecture> to show where domain services -- and in particular the domain services provided by http://isisaddons.org[Isis Addons] (non-ASF) -- fit in:

.The hexagonal architecture with Isis addons
image::{_imagesdir}how-tos/domain-services/hexagonal-architecture-addons.png[width="700px"]

Here, we can see that the addons provide services both to the Isis framework (for example security, command and auditing) and also - by way of dependency injection - to the domain objects (eg tags, excel, settings). Of course, you can also write your own domain services as well, for example to interface with some external CMS system, say.

The Apache Isis framework also provides a number of in-built domain services.
