By default, the name of a class member (a property, collection or action) presented to the user is derived, reflectively, from the name of the member defined in the program code. To specify a different name use the `@Named `annotation immediately before the member declaration.

[TIP]
====
Following the link:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself[don't repeat yourself] principle, we recommend that you only use this attribute when the desired name cannot be used in Java source code.  Examples of that include a name that would be a reserved Java keyword (eg "package"), or a name that has punctuation, eg apostrophes.

[NOTE]
====
This attribute can also be specified for xref:_ug_reference-annotations_manpage-ActionLayout_named[actions], xref:_ug_reference-annotations_manpage-PropertyLayout_named[properties], xref:_ug_reference-annotations_manpage-ParameterLayout_named[action parameters], xref:_ug_reference-annotations_manpage-DomainObjectLayout_named[domain objects], xref:_ug_reference-annotations_manpage-ViewModelLayout_named[view models] and xref:_ug_reference-annotations_manpage-DomainServiceLayout_named[domain services].

== named()

IMPORTANT: WIP ... this section


The `@Named` annotation is used when you want to specify the way
something is named on the user interface i.e. when you do not want to
use the name generated automatically by the system. It can be applied to
objects, members (properties, collections, and actions) and to
parameters within an action method.



For example:

[source,java]
----
public class Customer {

    public String getFirstName() { ... }

    public String getSurname() { ... }

    public CreditRating getCreditRating() { ... }
}
----

Note that the framework provides a separate and more powerful mechanism
for internationalisation.

As an alternative to using the annotation, the dynamic xref:_ug_wicket-viewer_layout_dynamic-object-layout[`.layout.json`]
can be used instead, eg:

[source,javascript]
