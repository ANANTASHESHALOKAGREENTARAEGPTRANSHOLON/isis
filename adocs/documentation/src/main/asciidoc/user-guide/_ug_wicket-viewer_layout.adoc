The wicket viewer has full support for the various methods of specifying the xref:_ug_reference-object-layout[layout of objects], either statically or dynamically.

Dynamic reloading is automatically supported when running in xref:_ug_runtime_deployment-types[prototype (development) mode], the Wicket viewer automatically rebuilds the metamodel for each class as it is rendered.    Conversely, do note that the Wicket viewer will _not_ pick up new metadata if running in production/server mode.


[TIP]
====
To pick up a change, edit the `.layout.json` file in the IDE and rebuild.  Then click on the title of the object _*twice*_.

The first click will cause Isis to pick up the new metadata, but too late in the process to adjust the rendering.  The second click will re-render the object with the new metadata.

The screenshots below show some of the effects that can be accomplished, for the open source link:https://github.com/estatio/estatio[Estatio] app.



First, an `Invoice`.  This places the properties in three equal-sized columns, with collections underneath:

image::{_imagesdir}wicket-viewer/layouts/estatio-Invoice.png[width="800px",link="{_imagesdir}wicket-viewer/layouts/estatio-Invoice.png"]



Next, `Lease`.  This places its properties in two columns (one wide, one narrow), with its collections shown in the right-most column:

image::{_imagesdir}wicket-viewer/layouts/estatio-Lease.png[width="800px",link="{_imagesdir}wicket-viewer/layouts/estatio-Lease.png"]



Next, `LeaseItem`.  This is similar to `Lease`, with two columns for properties and the third column for collections:

image::{_imagesdir}wicket-viewer/layouts/estatio-LeaseItem.png[width="800px",link="{_imagesdir}wicket-viewer/layouts/estatio-LeaseItem.png"]



And finally, from the (non-ASF) http://github.com/isisaddons/isis-app-todoapp[Isis addons' todoapp], its `ToDoItem`.  This puts its properties in two columns; the collections (not visible in the screenshot below) are underneath (like Estatio's `Invoice`):

[NOTE]

Note that this screencast shows an earlier version of the xref:_ug_wicket-viewer[Wicket viewer] UI (specifically, pre 1.8.0).

== Required updates to the dom project's pom.xml

If using the `.layout.json` files, these must be compiled and available in the classpath. When using an IDE such as Eclipse+M2E, any `.layout.json` files in `src/main/java` or `src/main/resources` will be part of the classpath automatically. However, unless the `pom.xml` is changed, these will not be part of the compiled WAR.

Therefore, make sure the following is added to the dom project's `pom.xml`:

[source.xml]
----
<resources>
    <resource>
        <filtering>false</filtering>
        <directory>src/main/resources</directory>
    </resource>
    <resource>
        <filtering>false</filtering>
        <directory>src/main/java</directory>
        <includes>
            <include>**</include>
        </includes>
        <excludes>
            <exclude>**/*.java</exclude>
        </excludes>
    </resource>
</resources>
----

If using an Isis xref:_ug_getting-started_simpleapp-archetype[SimpleApp archetype], then the POM is already correctly configured.
