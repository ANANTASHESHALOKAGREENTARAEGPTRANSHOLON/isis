In conjunction with xref:_ug_runtime_application-specific_application-css[`application.css`], can therefore provide custom styling of an object instance wherever it is rendered.
See also xref:_ug_reference-methods_reserved_manpage-title[`title()`] and xref:_ug_reference-methods_reserved_manpage-iconName[`iconName()`].

|xref:_ug_reference-methods_reserved_manpage-disable[`disable(...)`]
|Disable all or some of an object's properties

|xref:_ug_reference-methods_reserved_manpage-hide[`hide(...)`]
|Hide all or some of an object's properties

|xref:_ug_reference-methods_reserved_manpage-iconName[`iconName()`]
|Provides the name of the image to render, usually alongside the title, to represent the object. If not provided, then the class name is used to locate an image.
See also xref:_ug_reference-methods_reserved_manpage-title[`title()`] and xref:_ug_reference-methods_reserved_manpage-cssClass[`cssClass()`]

|xref:_ug_reference-methods_reserved_manpage-getId[`getId()`]
|Provides an optional unique identifier of a service. +
If not provided, the service's fully-qualified class name is used.

|xref:_ug_reference-methods_reserved_manpage-title[`title()`]
|Provides a title for the object. +
Alternatively, use the xref:_ug_reference-annotations_manpage-Title[`@Title`] annotation. +
See also `iconName()` and xref:_ug_reference-methods_reserved_manpage-cssClass[`cssClass()`]

|xref:_ug_reference-methods_reserved_manpage-validate[`validate()`]
|Validate the object's state prior to persisting.

|===





The lifecycle callback methods notify a domain entity about its interaction within the persistence lifecycle.  For example, the entity is notified immediately prior to being persisted, or when it is about to be updated.

[WARNING]
====
We believe there may some scenarios (not yet fully catalogued) where the lifecycle method is not called.  As such we recommend that you don't rely on these methods and/or fully test they are called as required in your apps

As an alternative, consider using Isis' event bus and domain events.

The lifecycle methods are:
