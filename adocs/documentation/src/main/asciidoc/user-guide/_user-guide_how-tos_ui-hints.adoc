IMPORTANT: TODO

## Icons and Titles

### Object Title

#### Titles in Tables

#### Hide part of a title

### Object Icon

### Object CSS Styling

## Names and Descriptions

NOTE: see also i18n (TODO: convert to link)

### Class (object)

### Property

### Collections

### Actions

### Action Parameters

Use `@ParameterLayout(named=...)` or `@Named(...)`

[TIP]
====
If you're running on Java 8, then note that it's possible to write Isis applications without using `@ParameterLayout(named=...)` annotation.  Support for this can be found in the http://github.com/isisaddons/isis-metamodel-paraname8}[Isis addons' paraname8] metamodel extension (non-ASF).  (In the future we'll fold this into core).  See also our guidance on <<_upgrading_to_java_8_1_9_0_snapshot_and_later,upgrading to Java 8>>.
