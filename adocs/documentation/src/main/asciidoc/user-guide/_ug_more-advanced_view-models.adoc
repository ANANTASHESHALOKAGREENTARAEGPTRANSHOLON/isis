IMPORTANT: WIP - xref:_ug_reference-annotations_manpage-ViewModel[`@ViewModel`], xref:_ug_reference-classes_super_manpage-AbstractViewModel[`AbstractViewModel`], xref:_ug_reference-annotations_manpage-DomainObject_nature[`@DomainObject#nature()`]


Nature of view models

* inmemory-entity
* external_entity
* application layer

Consumers of view models

* within the Wicket viewer
* within the REST viewer, as an external client consuming a stable API

An alternative to using view models is to map the domain object using the xref:_ug_reference-services-spi_manpage-ContentMappingService[`ContentMappingService`].
