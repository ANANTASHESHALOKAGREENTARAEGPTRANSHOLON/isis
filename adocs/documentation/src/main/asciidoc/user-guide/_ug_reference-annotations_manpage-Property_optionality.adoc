By default, the system assumes that all properties of an object are required, and therefore will not let the user save a new object unless a value has been specified for each property. Similarly, by default, the system assumes that all parameters in an action are required and will not let the user execute that action unless values have been specified for each parameter.

To indicate that either a property, or an action parameter, is optional, use the `@Optional` annotation.


[TIP]
====
The `@Optional`annotation has no meaning for a primitive property (or parameter) such as `int` - because primitives will always return a default value (e.g. zero). If optionality is required, then use the corresponding wrapper class (e.g. `java.lang.Integer`).
====



For example:

[source,java]
----
public class Order {
    public Product getProduct() { ... }

    public java.util.Date getShipDate() { ... }
    public void setShipDate(Date java.util.shipDate) { ... }

    @Optional
    public String getComments() { ... }
    public void setComments(String comments) { ... }
}
----

Here the `product` and `shipDate` properties are both required, but the
`comments` property is optional.
