IMPORTANT: TODO


Title: @CollectionLayout (1.8.0)

The `@CollectionLayout` annotation applies to collections, collecting together all UI hints within a single
annotation.

* `cssClass` - the css class that a collection should have, to allow more targetted styling in `application.css`
* `describedAs` - description of this collection, eg to be rendered in a tooltip.
* `hidden` - indicates where in the UI the collection should _not_ be visible in the UI (only NOWHERE or EVERWHERE/ANYWHERE)
* `named` -the name of this collection (overriding the name derived from its name in code)
* `namedEscaped` - whether to HTML escape the name of this property. Defaults to true.
* `paged` - the page size for instances of this class when rendered within a table.
* `render` - that the rendering of a collection should be performed LAZILY or EAGERLY
* `sortedBy` - Indicates that the elements in a ({@link java.util.SortedSet}) collection should be sorted according to a different order than the natural sort order, as defined by the specified{@link java.util.Comparator}

For example:

[source]
----
public class ToDoItem {

    @CollectionLayout(
        cssClass="x-key",
        named="Todo items that are <i>dependencies</i> of this item.",
        namedEscaped=false,
        describedAs="Other todo items that must be completed before this one",
        labelPosition=LabelPosition.LEFT,
        render=EAGERLY
        typicalLength=80)
    public SortedSet<ToDoItem> getDependencies() { ... }

    ...
}
----

It is also possible to apply the annotation to actions of domain services that are acting as link:../../more-advanced-topics/how-to-01-062-How-to-decouple-dependencies-using-contributions.html[contributed collections].

== `cssClass()`

Title: @CssClass

____

Deprecated, use instead link:./DomainObjectLayout.html[@DomainObjectLayout#cssClass()], link:./PropertyLayout.html[@PropertyLayout#cssClass()], link:./CollectionLayout.html[@CollectionLayout#cssClass()], link:./ActionLayout.html[@ActionLayout#cssClass()] and link:./ParameterLayout.html[@ParameterLayout#cssClass()], or use link:../../components/viewers/wicket/dynamic-layouts.html[dynamic layouts].

____

The `CssClass` annotation applies to object and also to any object member
(property, collection or action). It is used by the Wicket viewer as a UI hint
to render specified CSS classes around the representation of the element.

Application-specific CSS can then be used to target and adjust the UI representation
of that particular element.

For example:

[source]
----
@CssClass("x-main")
public class ToDoItem { ... }
----

or

[source]
----
public class ToDoItem {

    @CssClass("x-key")
    public LocalDate getDueBy() { ... }

}
----

== Alternatives (`.layout.json`)

As an alternative to using the `@CssClass` annotation, the `.layout.json`
link:../../components/viewers/wicket/dynamic-layouts.html[dynamic layout file]
can be specified, eg:

[source]
----
{
    "span": 6,
    "memberGroups": {
        "Priority": {
            "members": {
                ...
                "dueBy": {
                    "cssClass": { "value": "x-key" }
                }
                ....
            }
        },
        ...
    }
}
----

Note that this (currently) only supports class members, not classes

== See also (1.8.0)

The similar link:./CssClassFa-deprecated.html[CssClassFa] annotation is also used as a hint
to apply CSS, but in particular to allow http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/icons/[Font Awesome icons]
to be rendered on action butotns or as the icon for classes.





== `describedAs()`

Title: @DescribedAs

____

Deprecated, use instead link:./DomainObjectLayout.html[@DomainObjectLayout#describedAs()], link:./PropertyLayout.html[@PropertyLayout#describedAs()], link:./CollectionLayout.html[@CollectionLayout#describedAs()], link:./ActionLayout.html[@ActionLayout#describedAs()] and link:./ParameterLayout.html[@ParameterLayout#describedAs()], or use link:../../components/viewers/wicket/dynamic-layouts.html[dynamic layouts].

____

The `@DescribedAs` annotation is used to provide a short description of
something that features on the user interface. How this description is
used will depend upon the viewing mechanism - but it may be thought of
as being like a 'tool tip'.

Descriptions may be provided for objects, members (properties,
collections and actions), and for individual parameters within an action
method. `@DescribedAs` therefore works in a very similar manner to
`@Named` <!--(see ?)-->.

=== Providing a description for an object

To provide a description for an object, use the `@DescribedAs`
annotation immediately before the declaration of that object class.

For example:

[source]
----
@DescribedAs("A customer who may have originally become known to us via " +
             "the marketing system or who may have contacted us directly.")
public class ProspectiveSale {
   ...
}
----

=== Providing a description for an object member

Any member (property, collection or action) may provide a description.
To specify this description, use the `@DescribedAs` annotation
immediately before the declaration of that member.

For example:

[source]
----
public class Customer {
    @DescribedAs("The name that the customer has indicated that they wish to be " +
                 "addressed as (e.g. Johnny rather than Jonathan)")
    public String getFirstName() { ... }
}
----

=== Providing a description for an action parameter

To provide a description for an individual action parameter, use the
`@DescribedAs` annotation in-line i.e. immediately before the parameter
declaration.

For example:

[source]
----
public class Customer {
    public Order placeOrder(
                      Product product,
                      @Named("Quantity")
                      @DescribedAs("The quantity of the product being ordered")
                      int quantity) {
        Order order = createTransientInstance(Order.class);
        order.modifyCustomer(this);
        order.modifyProduct(product);
        order.setQuantity(quantity);
        return order;
    }
    ...
}
----




== `hidden()`

Title: @Hidden

____

Deprecated. For object members use link:./Property.html[@Property#hidden()] or link:./PropertyLayout.html[@PropertyLayout#hidden()], link:./Collection.html[@Collection#hidden()] or link:./CollectionLayout.html[@CollectionLayout#hidden()], and link:./ActionLayout.html[@ActionLayout#hidden()]. For domain servicesm use [@DomainService#nature()]

____

The `@Hidden` annotation indicates that the member (property, collection
or action) to which it is applied should never be visible to the user.
It can also be applied to service types (it has no effect if applied to
entities or values).

For example:

[source]
----
public class Customer {
    @Hidden
    public int getInternalId() { ... }

    @Hidden
    public void updateStatus() { ... }
    ...
}
----

Or, applied to a service:

[source]
----
@Hidden
public class EmailService {
    public void sendEmail(...) { ... }
    ...
}
----

This annotation can also take a parameters indicating where and when it
is to be hidden. For example:

[source]
----
public class Customer {
    @Hidden(when=When.ONCE_PERSISTED)
    public int getInternalId() { ... }
    ...
}
----

would show the `Id` until the object has been saved, and then would hide
it. And:

[source]
----
public class Customer {
    @Hidden(where=Where.ALL_TABLES)
    public int getDateOfBirth() { ... }
    ...
}
----

would suppress the `dateOfBirth` property of a Customer from all tables.

The acceptable values for the `where` parameter are:

* `Where.ANYWHERE` +
+
The member should be hidden everywhere.

* `Where.OBJECT_FORMS` +
+
The member should be hidden when displayed within an object form.
For most viewers, this applies to property and collection members,
not actions.

* `Where.PARENTED_TABLES` +
+
The member should be hidden when displayed as a column of a table
within a parent object's collection. For most (all?) viewers, this
will have meaning only if applied to a property member.

* `Where.STANDALONE_TABLES` +
+
The member should be hidden when displayed as a column of a table
showing a standalone list of objects, for example as returned by a
repository query. For most (all?) viewers, this will have meaning
only if applied to a property member.

* `Where.ALL_TABLES` +
+
The member should be /hidden when displayed as a column of a table,
either an object's * collection or a standalone list. This combines
`PARENTED_TABLES` and `STANDALONE_TABLES`.

* `Where.NOWHERE` +
+
Acts as an override if a member would normally be hidden as a result
of some other convention. For example, if a property is annotated
with `@Title` <!--(see ?)-->, then normally this should be hidden from all
tables. Additionally annotating with `@Hidden(where=Where.NOWHERE)`
overrides this.

The acceptable values for the `when` parameter are:

* `When.ALWAYS` +
+
The member should be hidden at all times.

* `When.NEVER` +
+
The member should never be hidden (unless disabled through some
other mechanism, for example an imperative disableXxx() supporting
method)..

* `When.ONCE_PERSISTED` +
+
The member should be visible for transient objects, but hidden for
persisted objects.

* `When.UNTIL_PERSISTED` +
+
The member should be hidden for transient objects, but visible for
persisted objects.

By default the annotated property or action is always hidden (ie
defaults to `Where.ANYWHERE`, `When.ALWAYS`).












== `named()`

Title: @Named

____

Deprecated, use instead link:./DomainObjectLayout.html[@DomainObjectLayout#named()], link:./PropertyLayout.html[@PropertyLayout#named()], link:./CollectionLayout.html[@CollectionLayout#named()], link:./ActionLayout.html[@ActionLayout#named()] and link:./ParameterLayout.html[@ParameterLayout#named()], or use link:../../components/viewers/wicket/dynamic-layouts.html[dynamic layouts].

____

The `@Named` annotation is used when you want to specify the way
something is named on the user interface i.e. when you do not want to
use the name generated automatically by the system. It can be applied to
objects, members (properties, collections, and actions) and to
parameters within an action method.

____

*Warning*

Generally speaking it is better to rename the property, collection or
action. The only common case where `@Named` is common is to rename
parameters for built-in value types. Even here though a custom value
type can be defined using `@Value` so that the value type is used as the
parameter name. `@Named` may also be used if the name needs punctuation
or other symbols in the name presented to the user.

____

=== Specifying the name of an object

By default the name of an object is derived, reflectively from the class
name. To specify a different name for an object, use the `@Named`
annotation in front of the class declaration.

For example:

[source]
----
@Named("Customer")
public class CustomerImpl implements Customer{
   ...
}
----

See also the `@Plural` annotation <!--, ?-->.

=== Specifying the name of a class member

By default, the name of a class member (a property, collection or
action) presented to the user is derived, reflectively, from the name of
the member defined in the program code. To specify a different name use
the `@Named
`annotation immediately before the member declaration.

For example:

[source]
----
public class Customer {

    public String getFirstName() { ... }

    public String getSurname() { ... }

    public CreditRating getCreditRating() { ... }
}
----

Note that the framework provides a separate and more powerful mechanism
for internationalisation.

=== Specifying the name for an action parameter

The most common usage of `@Named` is be to specify names for the
parameters of an action. This is because the parameter name declared in
the code for the action method cannot be picked up reflectively (by
default, the user interface will use the type of the parameter as the
name; for a `String` or a `Boolean`, this is almost certainly not what is
required).

To specify the name of a parameter, the `@Named` annotation is applied
'in-line' (i.e. preceding the individual parameter declaration.

For example:

[source]
----
public class Customer {
    public Order placeOrder(
            Product product
           ,@Named("Quantity")
            int quantity) {
        Order order = newTransientInstance(Order.class);
        order.modifyCustomer(this);
        order.modifyProduct(product);
        order.setQuantity(quantity);
        return order;
    }
    ...
}
----

An alternative is to use a value type (though this introduces additional mapping complexity for both viewers and objectstore) <!--, as described in ?-->.












== `paged()`

Title: @Paged

____

Deprecated, use instead link:./CollectionLayout.html[@CollectionLayout] and link:./DomainObjectLayout.html[@DomainObjectLayout].

____

This annotation is used to indicate that parented and/or standalone
collections should be paginated.

When annotated on a collection, `@Paged` indicates the page size of a
parented collection. When annotated on a type, `@Paged` indicates the page
size of a standalone collection.

For example:

[source]
----
@Paged(30)
public class Order {

    @Paged(15)
    public List<LineItem> getDetails() {...}
}
----

This indicates a page size of 15 for parented collections, and a page
size of 30 for standalone collections.

When omitting a parameter value or omitting the annotation completely,
the configured defaults in `isis.properties` will be used.

For example:

[source]
----
isis.viewers.paged.standalone=20
isis.viewers.paged.parented=5
----

This indicates a page size of 5 for parented collections and a page size
of 20 for standalone collections.






== `render()`

Title: @Render

____

Deprecated, use instead link:./CollectionLayout.html[@CollectionLayout#render()]

____

The `@Render` annotation is a hint for properties and collections to
indicate that a value property should be rendered lazily (rather than
eagerly, as usual), or that a reference property or collection should be
rendered eagerly (rather than lazily, as usual).

Viewers can use this to present the property/collection in an
appropriate manner:

*

an `Order`'s `lineItems` collection might initially be rendered expanded
form so that the user could see a list of line items immediately
when the order is rendered. This is the most common use case.

*

a (reference) property of type `Address` might show the details of the
referenced `Address` in a box

At the same time, an object store might use this to defer lazy loading
of values that represent blobs or clobs.

For example:

[source]
----
public class Order {
    @Render(Type.EAGERLY)
    public List<LineItem> getDetails() { ... }

    ...
}
----

For properties and collections there is some similarity between this
concept and that of eager-loading as supported by some object stores.
Indeed, some object stores may choose use their own specific annotations
(eg a JDO default fetch group) in order to infer this semantic.






== `sortedBy()`

Title: @SortedBy

____

Deprecated, use instead link:./CollectionLayout.html[@CollectionLayout#sortedBy].

____

The `@SortedBy` annotation is an instruction hint for (`SortedSet`) collections to use the specified comparator rather than the natural ordering of the entity
(as would usually be the case).

For example, this is taken from the Isis addons example https://github.com/isisaddons/isis-app-todoapp/[todoapp] (not ASF):

[source]
----
public class ToDoItem implements Comparable<ToDoItem> {

    ...
    public static class DependenciesComparator implements Comparator<ToDoItem> {
        @Override
        public int compare(ToDoItem p, ToDoItem q) {
            return ORDERING_BY_DESCRIPTION
                    .compound(Ordering.<ToDoItem>natural())
                    .compare(p, q);
        }
    }

    ...
    @SortedBy(DependenciesComparator.class)
    public SortedSet<ToDoItem> getDependencies() { ... }

    public int compareTo(final ToDoItem other) {
        return ORDERING_BY_COMPLETE
                .compound(ORDERING_BY_DUE_BY)
                .compound(ORDERING_BY_DESCRIPTION)
                .compare(this, other);
    }
    ...
}
----

When the `dependencies` collection is rendered, the elements are sorted by the `description` property first:

![](images/sortedby-dependencies.png)

Without this annotation, the order would have been inverted (because the natural ordering places items not completed before those items that have been completed.
