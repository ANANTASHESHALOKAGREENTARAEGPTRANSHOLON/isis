|Property
|Value +
(_default value_)
|Description

|`isis.services`
|`FQCN`,`FQCN2`,...
|Fully qualified class names of classes to be instantiated as domain services.  Each entry can be optionally prefixed by "n:" specifying the relative order on the menu (corresponds to `@DomainServiceLayout#menuOrder()`).

|`isis.services.` +
`container.disableAutoFlush`
| `true`,`false` (`_false_`)
|Whether the `DomainObjectContainer` should automatically flush pending changes prior to querying (via `allMatches()`, `firstMatch()` and so on).

|`isis.services.` +
`translation.po.mode`
| `read`,`write`
|Whether to force the `TranslationService` into either read or write mode. +
See xref:_i18n[i18n support] to learn more about the translation service.

|`isis.persistor.` +
`disableConcurrencyChecking`
| `true`,`false` (`_false_`)
| Disables concurrency checking globally.  Only intended for "emergency use" as a workaround while pending fix/patch to Isis itself.  (Note that there is no "datanucleus" in the property).

|`isis.reflector.facet.` +
`cssClassFa.patterns`
|regex:fa-icon,regex2:fa-icon2,...
|Comma separated list of key:value pairs, where the key is a regex matching action names (eg `create.*`) and the value is a link:fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/icons/[font-awesome] icon name (eg `fa-plus`) to be applied (as per `@CssClassFa()`) to all action members matching the regex. +
See xref:_user-guide_how-tos_ui-hints_action-icons-and-css[UI hints] for more details.

|`isis.reflector.facet.` +
`cssClass.patterns`
|regex:css1,regex2:css2,...
|Comma separated list of key:value pairs, where the key is a regex matching action names (eg `delete.*`) and the value is a link:http://getbootstrap.com/css/[Bootstrap] CSS button class (eg `btn-warning) to be applied (as per `@CssClass()`) to all action members matching the regex. +
See xref:_user-guide_how-tos_ui-hints_action-icons-and-css[UI hints] for more details.

|`isis.reflector.facets`
|`FQCN`
|Fully qualified class names of a custom implementation of `ProgrammingModel` interface.
See xref:_finetuning[finetuning the programming model] for more details.

|`isis.reflector.facets.` +
`include`
|`FQCN`,`FQCN2`,...
|Fully qualified class names of (new, custom) facet factory classes to be included to the programming model. +
See xref:_finetuning[finetuning the programming model] for more details.

|`isis.reflector.facets.` +
`exclude`
|`FQCN`,`FQCN2`,...
|Fully qualified class names of (existing, built-in) facet factory classes to be included to the programming model. +
See xref:_finetuning[finetuning the programming model] for more details.

|`isis.reflector.validator`
|`FQCN`
|Custom implementation of `MetaModelValidator` (in the `org.apache.isis.core.metamodel.specloader.validator` package) +
See xref:_custom_validator[Custom Validator] to learn more.

|`isis.reflector.validator.` +
`allowDeprecated`
| `true`,`false` (`_true_`)
| Whether deprecated annotations or naming conventions are tolerated or not.  If not, then a metamodel validation error will be triggered, meaning the app won't boot (fail-fast).

|`isis.reflector.` +
`layoutMetadataReaders`
|`FQCN`,`FQCN2`,...
|Fully qualified class names of classes to be instantiated to read layout metadata, as used in for xref:_dynamic_object_layout[dynamic layout]s. +
See xref:_layout_metadata_reader[Layout Metadata Reader] for more information.
