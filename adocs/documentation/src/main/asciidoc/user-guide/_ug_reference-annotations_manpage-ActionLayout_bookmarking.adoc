The `bookmarking()` attribute indicates if an action (with safe xref:_ug_reference-annotations_manpage-Action_semantics[action semantics]) is automatically bookmarked.

(In the Wicket viewer), a link to a bookmarked object is shown in the bookmarks panel:

image::{_imagesdir}reference-annotations/ActionLayout/bookmarking.png[width="720px",link="{_imagesdir}reference-annotations/ActionLayout/bookmarking.png"]

[NOTE]
====
It is also possible to mark domain entities as xref:_ug_reference-annotations_manpage-DomainObjectLayout_bookmarking[bookmarkable]; the screenshot shows this.

Note also that this screenshot relates to a earlier version of the UI (specfically, pre 1.8.0).
====


For example:

[source,java]
----
public class ToDoItems {
    @Action(semantics=SemanticsOf.SAFE)
    @ActionLayout(bookmarking=BookmarkPolicy.AS_ROOT)
    @MemberOrder(sequence = "1")
    public List<ToDoItem> notYetComplete() {
        ...
    }
}
----

indicates that the `notYetComplete()` action is bookmarkable.



[NOTE]
====
The enum value `AS_CHILD` has no meaning for actions; it relates only to bookmarked xref:_ug_reference-annotations_manpage-DomainObject_bookmarking[domain object]s.
====



As an alternative to using the annotation, the dynamic xref:_ug_wicket-viewer_layout_dynamic-object-layout[`.layout.json`]
can be used instead, eg:

[source,javascript]
----
"notYetComplete": {
    "actionLayout": { "bookmarking": "AS_ROOT" }
}
----
