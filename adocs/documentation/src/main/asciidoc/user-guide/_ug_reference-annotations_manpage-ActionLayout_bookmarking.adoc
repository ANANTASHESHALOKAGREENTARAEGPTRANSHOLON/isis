IMPORTANT: WIP ... this section

The `@Bookmarkable` annotation indicates that an entity or an action (with safe link:./ActionSemantics.html[action semantics]) is automatically bookmarked.

(In the Wicket viewer), a link to a bookmarked object is shown in the bookmarks panel that slides out from the left:

<img src="images/Bookmarkable.png" width="640px"/>

For example:

[source,java]
----
@Bookmarkable
public class ToDoItem ... {
    ...
}
----

indicates that the `ToDoItem` class is bookmarkable, while:

[source,java]
----
@Named("ToDos")
public class ToDoItems {

    @Bookmarkable
    @ActionSemantics(Of.SAFE)
    @MemberOrder(sequence = "1")
    public List<ToDoItem> notYetComplete() {
        ...
    }

}
----

indicates that the "not yet complete" action is bookmarkable.

It is also possible to nest bookmarkable entities. For example, this screenshot is taken from http://github.com/estatio/estatio[Estatio]:

<img src="images/Bookmarkable-nested.png" width="640px"/>

For example, the `Property` entity "[OXF] Oxford Super Mall" is a root bookmark (the default), but the `Unit` child entity "[OXF-001] Unit 1" only appears as a bookmark if its parent `Property` has already been visited. This is accomplished with the following annotations:

[source,java]
----
@Bookmarkable
public class Property { ... }
----

and

[source,java]
----
@Bookmarkable(BookmarkPolicy.AS_CHILD)
public abstract class Unit { ... }
----

The nesting can be done to any level; the Estatio screenshot also shows a bookmark nesting 3 deep: `Lease` -&gt; `LeaseItem` -&gt; `LeaseTerm`.
