The `regexPattern()` attribute validates the contents of any string parameter with respect to a regular expression pattern. It is ignored if applied to parameters of any other type. This attribute can also be specified for xref:_ug_reference-annotations_manpage-Property_regexPattern[properties].

The related `regexPatternFlags()` attribute specifies flags that modify the handling of the pattern.  The values are those that would normally be passed to `java.util.regex.Pattern#compile(String,int)`.

For example:

[source,java]
----
public class Customer {
    public void updateEmail(
            @Parameter(
                regexPattern = "(\\w+\\.)*\\w+@(\\w+\\.)+[A-Za-z]+",
                regexPatternFlags=Pattern.CASE_INSENSITIVE
            )
            @ParameterLayout(named = "Email")
            final String email) {
        ...
    }
)
----

The related `regexPatternReplacement()` attribute is currently unused.
