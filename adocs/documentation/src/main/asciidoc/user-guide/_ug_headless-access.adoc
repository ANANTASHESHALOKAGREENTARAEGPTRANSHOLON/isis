This chapter tackles the topic of enabling access to an Isis application directly, or at least, not through either the xref:_wicket_viewer[Wicket] or xref:_restfulobjects_viewer[Restful] viewers.

There are several main use-cases:

* enabling background execution, eg of a thread managed by Quartz scheduler and running within the webapp

* integration from other systems, eg for a subscriber on a pub/sub mechanism such as Camel, pushing changes through an Isis domain model.

* leveraging an Isis application within a batch process

Note that the calling thread runs in the same process space as the Isis domain object model (must be physically linked to the JAR files containing the domain classes).  For use cases where the calling thread runs in some other process space (eg migrating data from a legacy system), then the xref:_restfulobjects_viewer[Restful Objects viewer] is usually the way to go.

The API described in this chapter is reasonably low-level, allowing code to interact very directly with the Isis metamodel and runtime.  Such callers should be considered trusted: they do not (by default) honour any business rules eg implicit in the Isis annotations or hide/disable/validate methods.  However the <<WrapperFactory>> service could be used to enforce such business rules if required.


== AbstractIsisSessionTemplate

The `AbstractIsisSessionTemplate` class (whose name is inspired by the Spring framework's naming convention for similar classes that query http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/2.5.x/reference/jdbc.html#jdbc-JdbcTemplate[JDBC], http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/2.5.x/reference/jms.html#jms-jmstemplate[JMS], http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/2.5.x/reference/orm.html#orm-jpa-template[JPA] etc.) provides the mechanism to open up a 'session' within the Isis framework, in order to resolve and interact with entities.

The class itself is intended to be subclassed:

[source,java]
----
public abstract class AbstractIsisSessionTemplate {

    public void execute(final AuthenticationSession authSession, final Object context) { ... } //<1>
    protected abstract void doExecute(Object context); // <2>

    protected ObjectAdapter adapterFor(final Object targetObject) { ... }
    protected ObjectAdapter adapterFor(final RootOid rootOid) { ... }

    protected PersistenceSession getPersistenceSession() { ... }
    protected IsisTransactionManager getTransactionManager() { ... }
    protected AdapterManager getAdapterManager() { ... }
}
----
<1> `execute(...)` sets up the `IsisSession` and delegates to ...
<2> `doExecute(...)`, the mandatory hook method for subclasses to implement.
The passed object represents passes a context from the caller (eg the scheduler, cron job, JMS etc) that instantiated and executed the class.

The `protected` methods expose key internal APIs within Isis, for the subclass to use as necessary.


[TIP]
====
One notable feature of `AbstractIsisSessionTemplate` is that it will automatically inject any domain services into itself. Thus, it is relatively easy for the subclass to "reach into" the domain, through injected repository services.
====



== BackgroundCommandExecution

The `BackgroundCommandExecution` class (a subclass of <<AbstractIsisSessionTemplate>>) is intended to simplify the execution of background ``Command``s persisted by way of the <<CommandService>> and the <<BackgroundCommandService>>.

Its signature is:

[source,java]
----
public abstract class BackgroundCommandExecution extends AbstractIsisSessionTemplate {
    protected void doExecute(Object context) { ... }
    protected abstract List<? extends Command> findBackgroundCommandsToExecute(); // <1>
}
----
<1> `findBackgroundCommandsToExecute()` is a mandatory hook method for subclasses to implement.

This allows for different implementations of the `CommandService` and `BackgroundCommandService` to persist to wherever.

The diagram below shows the dependencies between these various classes:

=== Background Execution using Isis Addons Command Module (not ASF)

The `BackgroundCommandExecutionFromBackgroundCommandServiceJdo` is a concrete subclass of <<BackgroundCommandExecution>>, the intended use being for the class to be instantiated regularly (eg every 10 seconds) by a scheduler such as http://quartz-scheduler.org[Quartz]) to poll for ``Command``s to be executed, and then execute them.

This implementation queries for ``Command``s persisted by the http://isisaddons.org/isis-module-command[Isis addons Command Module]'s  implementations of <<CommandService>> and <<BackgroundCommandService>> using the `BackgroundCommandServiceJdoRepository`.
