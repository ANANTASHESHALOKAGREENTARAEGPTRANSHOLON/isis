Apache Isis has built-in support for authentication and authorization:

* By "authentication" we mean logging into the application using some credentials, typically a username and password.  Authentication also means looking up the set of roles to which a user belongs.

* By "authorization" we mean permissions: granting roles to have access to features of the app.

Isis provides an API for both authentication and authorization, and provides an implementation that integrates with link:http://shiro.apache.org[Apache Shiro].  Shiro in turn uses the concept of a _realm_ as a source for both authentication and optionally authorization.

Shiro ships with a simple text-based realm -- the `IniRealm` -- which reads users (and password), user roles and role permissions from the `WEB-INF/shiro.ini` file.  The <<_simpleapp_archetype, SimpleApp archetype>> is configured to use this realm.

Shiro also ships with an implementation of an LDAP-based realm; LDAP is often used to manage user/passwords and corresponding user groups.  Isis in turn extends this with its `IsisLdapRealm`, which provides more flexibility for both group/role and role/permissions management.

In addition, the http://isisaddons.org[Isis Addons] (non-ASF) provides the http://github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-security}[Isis addons' security] module, which also provides an implementation of the Shiro `Realm` API.  However, the security module also represents users, roles and permissions as domain objects, allowing them to be administered through Isis itself.  Moreover, the security module can optionally delegate password management to a subsidiary (delegate) realm (usually LDAP as discussed above).

In addition to Isis' Shiro-based implementation of its authentication and authorization APIs, Isis also provides a "bypass" implementation, useful for quick-n-dirty prototyping when you want to in effect disable (bypass) security completely.

[NOTE]
.What about auditing?
====
A further aspect of security is auditing: recording what data was modified by which user.   Apache Isis does define two service APIs -- <<_command_service, `CommandService`>> and <<_auditing_service, `AuditingService`>> -- that provide hooks to track which actions (commands) are invoked, and what data was modified as a result (auditing).

Isis does not itself provide any in-built implementations of these APIs, but there are implementations within http://isisaddons.org[Isis Addons] (non-ASF), namely the http://github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-command}[Isis addons' command] module and the http://github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-auditing}[Isis addons' auditing] module.
