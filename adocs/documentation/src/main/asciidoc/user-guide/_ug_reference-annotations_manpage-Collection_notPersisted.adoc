IMPORTANT: WIP ... this section

The `@NotPersisted` annotation indicates that the property is not to be
persisted.


[TIP]
====
In many cases the same thing can be achieved simply by providing the property with a 'getter' but no 'setter'.
====

For example:

[source,java]
----
public class Order {

    @NotPersisted
    public Order getPreviousOrder() {...}
    public void setPreviousOrder(Order previousOrder) {...}

    ...
}
----
