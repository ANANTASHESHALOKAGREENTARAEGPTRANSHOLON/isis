The `publishing()` attribute (and related `publishingPayloadFactory()` attribute) determine whether and how an action is published via the registered implementation of a xref:_ug_reference-services-spi_manpage-PublishingService[`PublishingService`]).  A common use case is to notify external "downstream" systems of changes in the state of the Isis application.



== `publishing()`

This attribute indicates whether the action invocation should be published to the xref:_ug_reference-services-spi_manpage-PublishingService[`PublishingService`].

The default is `AS_CONFIGURED`, meaning that the configuration property `isis.services.publish.actions` is used to determine the whether the action is published:

* `all` +
+
all actions are published

* `ignoreSafe` (or `ignoreQueryOnly`) +
+
actions with safe (read-only) semantics are ignored, but actions which may modify data are not ignored

* `none` +
+
no actions are published

If there is no configuration property in `isis.properties` then publishing is automatically enabled.

This default can be overridden on an action-by-action basis; if `publishing()` is set to `ENABLED` then the action is published irrespective of the configured value; if set to `DISABLED` then the action is NOT published irrespective of the configured value.

For example:

[source,java]
----
public class Order {
    @Action(publishing=Publishing.ENABLED)
    public Invoice generateInvoice(...) { ... }
}
----

will be published irrespective of the configured value.




== `publishingPayloadFactory()`

The `publishingPayloadFactory()` specifies the class to use to create the (payload of the) event to be published by the publishing factory.
Rather than simply broadcast that the action was invoked, the payload factory allows a "fatter" payload to be isntantiated
that can eagerly push commonly-required information to all subscribers. For at least some subscribers this should avoid
the necessity to query back for additional information.
