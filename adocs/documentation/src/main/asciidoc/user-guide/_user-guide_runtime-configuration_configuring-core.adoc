|Description

|`isis.services`
|`FQCN`,`FQCN2`,...
|Fully qualified class names of classes to be instantiated as domain services.  Each entry can be optionally prefixed by "n:" specifying the relative order on the menu (corresponds to `@DomainServiceLayout#menuOrder()`).

|`isis.services.` +
`container.disableAutoFlush`
|`true`,`_false_`
|Whether the `DomainObjectContainer` should automatically flush pending changes prior to querying (via `allMatches()`, `firstMatch()` and so on).

|`isis.persistor.` +
`disableConcurrencyChecking`
|`true`,`_false_`
| Disables concurrency checking globally.  Only intended for "emergency use" as a workaround while pending fix/patch to Isis itself.  (Note that there is no "datanucleus" in the property).

|`isis.reflector.facet.` +
`cssClassFa.patterns`
|regex:fa-icon,regex2:fa-icon2,...
|Comma separated list of key:value pairs, where the key is a regex matching action names (eg `create.*`) and the value is a link:fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/icons/[font-awesome] icon name (eg `fa-plus`) to be applied (as per `@CssClassFa()`) to all action members matching the regex.

|`isis.reflector.facet.` +
`cssClass.patterns`
|regex:css1,regex2:css2,...
|Comma separated list of key:value pairs, where the key is a regex matching action names (eg `delete.*`) and the value is a link:http://getbootstrap.com/css/[Bootstrap] CSS button class (eg `btn-warning) to be applied (as per `@CssClass()`) to all action members matching the regex.
