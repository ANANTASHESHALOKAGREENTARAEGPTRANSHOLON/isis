The http://isisaddons.org[Isis Addons] website provides a number of reusable modules and other extensions for Apache Isis.  This chapter focuses just on the modules, all of which have a name of the form `isis-module-xxx`.

[WARNING]
====
Note that Isis addons, while maintained by Isis committers, are not part of the ASF.
====



The modules themselves fall into four broad groups:

* modules that provide an implementations of API defined by Apache Isis +
+
where Isis has hooks to use the service if defined by provides no implementations of its own.  The http://github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-command[command], http://github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-audit[auditing], http://github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-publishing[publishing], http://github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-security[security]  and http://github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-sessionlogger[sessionlogger] modules fall into this category.  Typically the domain objects themselves wouldn't interact with these services

* modules that provide standalone domain services with their own API and implementation +
+
These are simply intended to be used by domain objects.  The http://github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-docx[docx], http://github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-excel[excel], http://github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-settings[settings] and http://github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-stringinterpolator[stringinterpolator] fall into this category.

* modules that provide standalone domain entities (and supporting services) for a particular subdomain +
+
The http://github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-tags[tags] module falls into this category

* modules that provide developer utilities +
+
Not intended for use by either the framework or domain objects, but provide utilities that the developer themselves might use.  The http://github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-devutils[devutils] module (not suprisingly) falls into this category

Each of the modules has a full README and example application demonstrating their usage.  The sections below briefly outline the capabilities of these modules.

=== Event Serializer

Isis' PublishingService API also has a companion API, the `EventSerializer`.  This provides a pluggable mechanism by which the event can be rendered into different formats.

The http://github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-publishing[Isis addons' publishing] module provides an implementation of this API -- `RestfulObjectsSpecEventSerializer` -- that reuses part of the implementation of the Restful Objects viewer to serialize the the provided `EventPayload` into the form specified by the http://restfulobjects.org[Restful Objects spec].

For example, this is the JSON generated on an action invocation:

.JSON generated by action invocation
image::{_imagesdir}isis-addons-modules/action-invocation-published-to-stderr.png[width="750px"]

while this is the object change JSON:

.JSON generated by action invocation
image::{_imagesdir}isis-addons-modules/changed-object-published-to-stderr.png[width="750px"]

You could if you wish change the representation by registering your own implementation of this API in `isis.properties`:

[source,ini]
----
isis.services=...\
       com.mycompany.myapp.MyEventSerializer,\
       ...
