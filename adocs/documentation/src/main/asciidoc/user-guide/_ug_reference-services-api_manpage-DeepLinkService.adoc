Title: Deep Link Service (1.8.0)

The `DeepLinkService` provides the ability to obtain a `java.net.URI` that links to a representation of any (persisted) domain entity or
view model.

The framework currently provides a single implementation for accessing the representation provided by the Wicket viewer.

== API

The API defined by `DeepLinkService` is:

[source,java]
----
public interface DeepLinkService {

    /**
     * Creates a URI that can be used to obtain a representation of the provided domain object in one of the
     * Isis viewers.
     */
    URI deepLinkFor(Object domainObject);
}
----

== Implementations

== Usage within the framework

At the time of writing there is no usage within the core framework, though this service is (planned to be) used by
some of the http://www.isisaddons.org[Isis addons].

== Implementations

The Wicket viewer core framework provides a default implementation of this API:

* `org.apache.isis.viewer.wicket.viewer.services.DeepLinkServiceWicket`




== Registering the Services

Assuming that the `configuration-and-annotation` services installer is configured:

[source,ini]
----
isis.services-installer=configuration-and-annotation
----

and that the xref:_ug_wicket-viewer[Wicket viewer] is being used then an implementation of `DeepLinkService` is automatically registered and injected (it is annotated with `@DomainService`) so no further configuration is required.
