=== Bookmarked pages

The Wicket viewer supports the bookmarking of both domain objects and query-only (<<_actionsemantics, @ActionSemantics>>) actions.

Domain objects, if bookmarkable, can be nested.

Bookmarking is automatic; whenever a bookmarkable object/action is visited, then a bookmark is created. To avoid the number of bookmarks from indefinitely growing, bookmarks that have not been followed after a whle are automatically removed (an MRU/LRU algorithm). The number of bookmarks to preserve can be configured.

==== Screenshots

The following screenshot, taken from https://github.com/isisaddons/isis-app-todoapp[Isisaddons example todoapp] (not ASF) shows how the bookmarks are listed in a sliding panel.

Note how the list contains both domain objects and an action ("not yet complete").

Bookmarks can also form a hierarchy.  The following screenshot, also taken from the https://github.com/estatio/estatio[Estatio] application, shows a variety of different bookmarked objects with a nested structure:

====

Some - like `Property`, `Lease` and `Party` - are root nodes. However, `LeaseItem` is bookmarkable as a child of `Lease`, and `LeaseTerm` is bookmarkable only as a child of `LeaseItem`. This parent/child relationship is reflected in the layout.

==== Domain Code

To indicate a class is bookmarkable, use the <<_domainobjectlayout, @DomainObjectLayout>> annotation:

[source,java]
----
@DomainObjectLayout(
    bookmarking=BookmarkPolicy.AS_ROOT
)
public class Lease { ... }
----

To indicate a class is bookmarkable but only as a child of some parent bookmark, specify the bookmark policy:

[source,java]
----
@DomainObjectLayout(
    bookmarking=BookmarkPolicy.AS_CHILD
)
public class LeaseItem { ... }
----

To indicate that a safe (query only) action is bookmarkable, use the <<_actionlayout, @ActionLayout>> annotation:

[source,java]
----
public class ToDoItem ... {
    ...
    @ActionLayout(
         bookmarking=BookmarkPolicy.AS_ROOT
     )
    @ActionSemantics(Of.SAFE)
    public List<ToDoItem> notYetComplete() { ... }
    ...
}
----

[NOTE]
====
The BookmarkPolicy.AS_CHILD does not have a meaning for actions; if the `bookmarking` attribute is set to any other value, it will be ignored.
====

==== User Experience

The sliding panel appears whenever the mouse pointer hovers over the thin blue tab (to the left of the top header region).

Alternatively, `alt+[` will toggle open/close the panel; it can also be closed using `Esc` key.

==== Related functionality

The <<_recent_pages, Recent Pages>> also lists recently visited pages, selected from a drop-down.

==== Configuration

By default, the bookmarked pages panel will show a maximum of 15 'root' pages. This can be overridden using a property (in `isis.properties`), for example:

[source,ini]
----
isis.viewer.wicket.bookmarkedPages.maxSize=20
----

=== Brand logo

By default the Wicket viewer will display the application name top-left in the header menu. This can be changed to
display a png logo instead.

==== Screenshots

The screenshot below shows the Isis addons example https://github.com/isisaddons/isis-app-todoapp/[todoapp] (not ASF) with a 'brand logo' image in its header:

image::{_imagesdir}wicket-viewer/brand-logo/brand-logo.png[width="750px"]

A custom brand logo (typically larger) can also be specified for the signin page:

image::{_imagesdir}wicket-viewer/brand-logo/brand-logo-signin.png[width="750px"]

==== Configuration

In the application-specific subclass of `IsisWicketApplication`, bind:

* a string with name "brandLogoHeader" to the URL of a header image. A size of 160x40 works well.
* a string with name "brandLogoSignin" to the URL of a image for the sign-in page. A size of 400x100 works well.

For example:

[source,java]
----
@Override
protected Module newIsisWicketModule() {
    final Module isisDefaults = super.newIsisWicketModule();

    final Module overrides = new AbstractModule() {
        @Override
        protected void configure() {
            ...
            bind(String.class).annotatedWith(Names.named("brandLogoHeader"))
                              .toInstance("/images/todoapp-logo-header.png");
            bind(String.class).annotatedWith(Names.named("brandLogoSignin"))
                              .toInstance("/images/todoapp-logo-signin.png");
            ...
        }
    };

    return Modules.override(isisDefaults).with(overrides);
}
----

If the logo is hosted locally, add to the relevant directory (eg `src/main/webapp/images`). It is also valid for the
URL to be absolute.

You may also wish to tweak the `css/application.css`. For example, a logo with height 40px works well with the following:

[source,css]
----
.navbar-brand img {
    margin-top: -5px;
    margin-left: 5px;
}

== Hints and Tips

=== Application Menu Layout

The actions of domain services are made available as an application menu bar. By default each domain service
corresponds to a single menu on this menu bar, with its actions as the drop-down menu items. This is rarely exactly
what is required, however. The `@MemberOrder` and `@DomainServiceLayout` annotations can be used to rearrange the
placement of menu items.

The screenshots below are taken from http://github.com/estatio/estatio[Estatio], an open source estate management
application built using Apache Isis.

==== @DomainServiceLayout

Menus for domain services can be placed either on a primary, secondary or tertiary menu bar.

image::{_imagesdir}wicket-viewer/application-menu-layout-menus.png[width="800px"]

Within a single top-level menu (eg "Fixed Assets") there can be actions from multiple services. The Wicket viewer
automatically adds a divider between each:

image::{_imagesdir}wicket-viewer/application-menu-dividers.png[width="400px"]

In the example above the top-level menu combines the actions from the `Properties`, `Units` and `FixedAssetRegistrations`
services. The `Properties` service is annotated:

[source,java]
----
@DomainServiceLayout(
        named="Fixed Assets",
        menuBar = DomainServiceLayout.MenuBar.PRIMARY,
        menuOrder = "10.1"
)
public class Properties ... { ... }
----

while the `Units` service is annotated:

[source,java]
----
@DomainServiceLayout(
        named="Fixed Assets",
        menuBar = DomainServiceLayout.MenuBar.PRIMARY,
        menuOrder = "10.2"
)
public class Units ... { ... }
----

and similarly `FixedAssetRegistrations` is annotated:

[source,java]
----
@DomainServiceLayout(
        named="Fixed Assets",
        menuBar = DomainServiceLayout.MenuBar.PRIMARY,
        menuOrder = "10.3"
)
public class FixedAssetRegistrations ... { ... }
----

Note that in all three cases the value of the `named` attribute and the `menuBar` attribute is the same: "Fixed Assets"
and PRIMARY. This means that all will appear on a "Fixed Assets" menu in the primary menu bar.

Meanwhile the value of `menuOrder` attribute is significant for two reasons:

* for these three services on the same ("Fixed Assets") top-level menu, it determines the relative order of their sections (`Properties` first, then `Units`, then `FixedAssetRegistrations`)
* it determines the placement of the top-level menu itself ("Fixed Assets") with respect to other top-level menus on the menu bar.

To illustrate this latter point, the next top-level menu on the menu bar, "Parties", is placed after "Fixed Assets"
 because the `menuOrder` of the first of its domain services, namely the `Parties` service, is higher than that for
 "Fixed Assets":

[source,java]
----
@DomainServiceLayout(
        named="Parties",
        menuBar = DomainServiceLayout.MenuBar.PRIMARY,
        menuOrder = "20.1"
)
public class Parties ... { ... }
----

Note that only the `menuOrder` of the _first_ domain service is significant in placing the menus along the menu bar;
thereafter the purpose of the `menuOrder` is to order the menu services sections on the menu itself.

==== Ordering of a service's actions within a menu

For a given service, the actions within a section on a menu is determined by the `@MemberOrder` annotation. Thus, for
the `Units` domain service, its actions are annotated:

[source,java]
----
public class Units extends EstatioDomainService<Unit> {

    @MemberOrder(sequence = "1")
    public Unit newUnit( ... ) { ... }

    @MemberOrder(sequence = "2")
    public List<Unit> findUnits( ... ) { ... }

    @ActionLayout( prototype = true )
    @MemberOrder(sequence = "99")
    public List<Unit> allUnits() { ... }
    ...
}
----

Note that the last is also a prototype action (meaning it is only displayed in SERVER_PROTOTYPE (=Wicket Development) mode).
In the UI it is rendered in italics.

(It is possible to override this place of a given action by specifying `@MemberOrder(name=&quot;...&quot;)` where the name is
that of a top-level menu. Prior to 1.8.0 this was the only way of doing things, as of 1.8.0 its use
is not recommended).

==== Tertiary menubar

The tertiary menu bar consists of a single unnamed menu, rendered underneath the user's login, top right. This is
intended primarily for actions pertaining to the user themselves, eg their account, profile or settings:

<img src="images/application-menu-tertiary.png" width="200"></img>

Domain services' actions can be associated with the tertiary menu using the same `@DomainServiceLayout` annotation. For
example, the `updateEpochDate(...)` and `listAllSettings(...)` actions come from the following service:

[source,java]
----
@DomainServiceLayout(
        menuBar = DomainServiceLayout.MenuBar.TERTIARY,
        menuOrder = "10.1"
)
public class EstatioAdministrationService ... {

    @MemberOrder(sequence = "1")
    public void updateEpochDate( ... ) { ... }

    @MemberOrder(sequence = "2")
    public List<ApplicationSetting> listAllSettings() { ... }
    ...
}
----

Because the number of items on the tertiary menu is expected to be small and most will pertain to the current user, the
viewer does _not_ place dividers between actions from different services on the tertiary menu.


==== Isis Add-on modules

Some of the Isis add-ons modules also provide services whose actions appear in top-level menus.

The http://github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-security[security]'s module places its domain service menus in three
top-level menus:

* its `ApplicationUsers`, `ApplicationRoles`, `ApplicationPermission`, `ApplicationFeatureViewModels` and
 `ApplicationTenancies` domain services are all grouped together in a single "Security" top-level menu, on the
 SECONDARY menu bar

* its `SecurityModuleAppFixturesService` domain service, which allows the security modules' fixture scripts to be run,
 is placed on a "Prototyping" top-level menu, also on the SECONDARY menu bar

* its `MeService` domain service, which provides the `me()` action, is placed on the TERTIARY menu bar.

Meanwhile the http://github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-devutils[devutils] module places its actions - to download layouts and
so forth - on a "Prototyping" top-level menu, on the SECONDARY menu bar.

Currently there is no facility to alter the placement of these services. However, their UI can be suppressed
using security or using a <<_vetoing_visibility, vetoing subscriber>>.
