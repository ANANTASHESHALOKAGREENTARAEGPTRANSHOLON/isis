This section describes some of the core principles and values that the framework aims to honour and support.


== Decoupled (no "Big Ball of Mud")

IMPORTANT: TODO ...

Long-term Cost of ownership

Using:

* dependency injection of services
* OO design techniques, eg dependency inversion principle
* an in-memory event bus
* applib


== Honouring the Single Responsibility Principle

=== Behaviourally Complete vs Contributions




== Focuses on its Key Responsibilities

* Isis is at heart a metamodel with runtime, and coordinates interations using an AOP set of principles
* Apache Isis vs Isis Addons
* Apache Isis vs Shiro vs DataNucleus

[NOTE]

== Testable Applications

While Apache Isis can be used (very effectively) for simple CRUD-style applications, it is also intended to be used for complex business domains.  Ensuring that the business logic in such applications is correct means that the framework must (and does) provide robust testing support, both for developer-level unit testing and business-level (end-to-end) integration testing.
