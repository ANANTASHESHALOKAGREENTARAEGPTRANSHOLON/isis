IMPORTANT: WIP




The `ExceptionRecognizer` API (in the `org.apache.isis.applib.services.exceprecog` package) provides the mechanism for
both the domain programmer and also for components to be able to recognize and handle certain exceptions that may be
thrown by the system.

For example, the JDO Objectstore provides a set of recognizers to recognize and handle SQL constraint exceptions such as uniqueness violations. These can then be rendered back to the user as expected errors, rather than fatal stacktraces.



== API

The `ExceptionRecognizer` interface is defined as:

[source,java]
----
public interface ExceptionRecognizer {
    public String recognize(Throwable ex);
}
----

If the implementation recognizes the exception then it returns a user-friendly message to be rendered (by the viewer)
back to the user; otherwise it returns `null`. There is no need for the implementation to check for exception causes;
the casual chain is unwrapped by Isis core and each exception in the chain will also be passed through to the
recognizer (from most specific to least). The recognizer implementation can therefore be as fine-grained or as
coarse-grained as it wishes.

Typically implementations of `ExceptionRecognizer` are registered as services (in the `isis.properties` configuration
file). More than one recognizer can be registered; all we be checked if an exception is thrown.

== Extended API (1.8.0)

The `ExceptionRecognizer2` interface extends the original `ExceptionRecognizer` interface, being defined as:

[source]
----
public interface ExceptionRecognizer2 extends ExceptionRecognizer {

    public enum Category {
        CONSTRAINT_VIOLATION,
        NOT_FOUND,
        CONCURRENCY,
        CLIENT_ERROR,
        SERVER_ERROR,
        OTHER
    }

    public static class Recognition {
        private final Category category;
        private final String reason;

        public Recognition(Category category, String reason) {
            this.category = category;
            this.reason = reason;
        }

        public Category getCategory() { return category; }
        public String getReason() { return reason; }
    }

    public Recognition recognize2(final Throwable ex);
}
----

In essence, if an exception is recognized then it is also categorized. This lets the viewer act accordingly, for
example to raise a 404 (see 'Support' discussion below).

== Core Implementations

The `DomainObjectContainer` provided by Isis core is itself an `ExceptionRecognizer`, and will handle
`ConcurrencyException`s (raised by any objectstore). No configuration is required to enable this feature (neither can
it be disabled).

The JDO Objectstore (part of core) also provides a number of fine-grained implementations:

* `ExceptionRecognizerForSQLIntegrityConstraintViolationUniqueOrIndexException`
* `ExceptionRecognizerForJDOObjectNotFoundException`
* `ExceptionRecognizerForJDODataStoreException`

These are bundled up into a composite, `ExceptionRecognizerCompositeForJdoObjectStore`.

== Registering the Default Implementation

In most cases you should use the JDO Objectstore's `ExceptionRecognizerCompositeForJdoObjectStore` in your applicatio.
This service has _not_ been annotated with `@DomainService` and so requires explicit registration in
`WEB-INF/isis.properties`:

[source]
----
isis.services=...,\
              org.apache.isis.objectstore.jdo.applib.service.exceprecog.ExceptionRecognizerCompositeForJdoObjectStore,\
              ...
----

For simple apps this may in fact be the only service registered in `isis.properties`.

____

Explicit registration is required primarily to offer maximum flexibility and control.

== Checking for additional exceptions.

If you want to recognize and handle additional exceptions (for example to capture error messages specific to the
JDBC driver you might be using), then the recommended approach is to:

*

create a fine-grained implementation of `ExceptionRecognizer` (or `ExceptionRecognizer2`) for the particular error
message (there are some convenience implementations of the interface that you can subclass from if required)

*

register your implementation in `isis.properties`. More than one implementation of `ExceptionRecognizer` can be
 registered; all we be checked if an exception is thrown.

Alternatively, if you prefer to register just a single `ExceptionRecognizer` service class, you could create a
composite implementation that bundles up your fine-grained implementation; see the above
`ExceptionRecognizerCompositeForJdoObjectStore` for inspiration.

== Support

In 1.7.0, only the xref:_ug_wicket-viewer[Wicket viewer] supported this API.

In 1.8.0, some checking of exception recognizers has moved deeper into core, specifically the (JDO) objectstore.
In particular, if an exception is raised from the loading of an individual object, then this is passed by the
registered ExceptionRecognizers. If any of these recognize the exception as representing a not-found exception, then
a Isis `ObjectNotFoundException` is raised. Both the viewers interprets this correctly (the
xref:_ug_wicket-viewer[Wicket viewer] as a suitable error page, the
xref:_ug_restfulobjects-viewer[Restful Objects viewer] as a 404 status return code.
