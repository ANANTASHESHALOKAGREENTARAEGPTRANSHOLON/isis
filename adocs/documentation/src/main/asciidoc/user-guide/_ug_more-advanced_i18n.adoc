Apache Isis' support for i18n allows every element of the domain model (the class names, property names, action names, parameter names and so forth) to be translated.

It also supports translations of messages raised imperatively, by which we mean as the result of a call to `title()` to obtain an object's title, or messages messages resulting from any business rule violations (eg `disableXxx()` or `validateXxx()`, and so on.

Isis does not translate the values of your domain objects, though.  So, if you have a domain concept such as `Country` whose name is intended to be localized according to the current user, you will need to model



== Implementation Approach

Most Java frameworks tackle i18n by using Java's own `ResourceBundle` API.  However, there are some serious drawbacks in this approach, such as:

* if a string appears more than once (eg "name" or "description") then it must be translated everywhere it appears in every resource bundle file
* there is no support for plural forms (see this link:http://stackoverflow.com/a/14327683/56880[SO answer])
* there is no tooling support for translators

Apache Isis therefore takes a different approach, drawing inspiration from GNU's https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/index.html[gettext] API and specifically its `.pot` and `.po` files.  These are intended to be used as follows:

* the `.pot` (portable object template) file holds the message text to be translated
* this file is translated into multiple `.po` (portable object) files, one per supported locale
* these `.po` files are renamed according to their locale, and placed into the 'appropriate' location to be picked up by the runtime.  The name of each `.po` resolved in a very similar way to resource bundles.

The format of the `.pot` and `.po` files is identical; the only difference is that the `.po` file has translations for each of the message strings.   These message strings can also have singular and plural forms.


[IMPORTANT]
====
Although Isis' implementation is modelled after GNU's API, it does _not_ use any GNU software.  This is for two reasons: (a) to simplify the toolchain/developer experience, and (b) because GNU software is usually GPL, which would be incompatible with the Apache license).
====

This design tackles all the issues of ``ResourceBundle``s:

* the `.po` message format is such that any given message text to translate need only be translated once, even if it appears in multiple places in the application (eg "Name")
* the `.po` message format includes translations for (optional) plural form as well as singular form
* there are lots of freely available editors https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=.po+file+editor[to be found], many summarized on this https://www.drupal.org/node/11131[Drupal.org] webpage. +
+
In fact, there are also online communities/platforms of translators to assist with translating files. One such is https://crowdin.com/[crowdin] (nb: this link does not imply endorsement).

In Isis' implementation, if the translation is missing from the `.po` file then the original message text from the `.pot` file will be returned.  In fact, it isn't even necessary for there to be any `.po` files; `.po` translations can be added piecemeal as the need arises.




== Service API and Implementation

The cornerstone of Isis' support for i18n is the `TranslationService` service. This is defined in the applib with the following API:

[source,java]
----
public interface TranslationService {
    public String translate(      // <1>
            final String context,
            final String text);
    public String translate(      // <2>
            final String context,
            final String singularText,
            final String pluralText,
            final int num);
    public enum Mode {
        READ,
        WRITE;
    }
    Mode getMode();               // <3>
}
----
<1> is to translate the singular form of the text
<2> is to translate the plural form of the text
<3> indicates whether the translation service is in read or write mode.

The `translate(...)` methods are closely modelled on GNU's gettext API.  The first version is used when no translation is required, the second is when both a singular and plural form will be required, with the `num` parameter being used to select which is returned.  In both cases the `context` parameter provides some contextual information for the translator; this generally corresponds to the class member.

The mode meanwhile determines the behaviour of the service.  More on this below.

=== `TranslationServicePo` (implementation)

Isis provides a default implementation of `TranslationService`, namely `TranslationServicePo`.

If the service is running in the normal read mode, then it simply provides translations for the locale of the current user.  This means locates the appropriate `.po` file (based on the requesting user's locale), finds the translation and returns it.

If however the service is configured to run in write mode, then it instead records the fact that the message was requested to be translated (a little like a spy/mock in unit testing mock), and returns the original message. The service can then be queried to discover which messages need to be translated.  All requested translations are written into the `.pot` file.

To make the service as convenient as possible to use, the service configures itself as follows:

* if running in xref:_deployment_types[prototype mode] or during integration tests, then the service runs in _write_ mode, in which case it records all translations into the `.pot` file.  The `.pot` file is written out when the system is shutdown.
* if running in xref:_deployment_types[server (production) mode], then the service runs in _read_ mode. It is also possible to set a configuration setting in `isis.properties` to force read mode even if running in prototype mode (useful to manually test/demo the translations).

When running in write mode the original text is returned to the caller untranslated. If in read mode, then the translated `.po` files are read and translations provided as required.

== Translating validation and other (imperative) messages

The `TranslationService` is used internally by Isis when building up the metamodel; the name and description of every class, property, collection, action and action parameter is automatically translated.  Thus the simple act of bootstrapping Isis will cause most of the messages requiring translation (that is: those for the Isis metamodel) to be captured by the `TranslationService`.

However, for an application to be fully internationalized, any validation messages (from either `disableXxx()` or `validateXxx()` supporting methods) and also possibly an object's title (from the `title()` method) will also require translation. Moreover, these messages must be captured in the `.pot` file such that they can be translated.


=== `TranslatableString`

The first part of the puzzle is tackled by an extension to Isis' programming model.  Whereas previously the `disableXxx()` / `validateXxx()` / `title()` methods could only return a `java.lang.String`, they may now optionally return a `TranslatableString` (defined in Isis applib) instead.

Here's a (silly) example from the xref:_simpleapp_archetype[SimpleApp archetype]:

[source,java]
----
public TranslatableString validateUpdateName(final String name) {
    return name.contains("!")? TranslatableString.tr("Exclamation mark is not allowed"): null;
}
----

This corresponds to the following entry in the `.pot` file:

[source,ini]
----
#: dom.simple.SimpleObject#updateName()
msgid "Exclamation mark is not allowed"
msgstr ""
----

The full API of `TranslatableString` is modelled on the design of GNU gettext (in particular the https://code.google.com/p/gettext-commons/wiki/Tutorial[gettext-commons] library):

[source,java]
----
public final class TranslatableString {
    public static TranslatableString tr(       // <1>
            final String pattern,
            final Object... paramArgs) { ... }
    public static TranslatableString trn(      // <2>
            final String singularPattern,
            final String pluralPattern,
            final int number,
            final Object... paramArgs) { ... }
    public String translate(                   // <3>
            final TranslationService translationService,
            final String context) { ... }
}
----
<1> returns a translatable string with a single pattern for both singular and plural forms.
<2> returns a translatable string with different patterns for singular and plural forms; the one to use is determined by the 'number' argument
<3> translates the string using the provided `TranslationService`, using the appropriate singular/regular or plural form, and interpolating any arguments.

The interpolation uses the format `{xxx}`, where the placeholder can occur multiple times.

For example:

[source,java]
----
final TranslatableString ts = TranslatableString.tr(
    "My name is {lastName}, {firstName} {lastName}.",
    "lastName", "Bond", "firstName", "James");
----

would interpolate (for the English locale) as "My name is Bond, James Bond".

For a German user, on the other hand, if the translation in the corresponding `.po` file was:

[source,ini]
----
#: xxx.yyy.Whatever#context()
msgid "My name is {lastName}, {firstName} {lastName}."
msgstr "Iche heisse {firstName} {lastName}."
----

then the translation would be: "Ich heisse James Bond".


The same class is used in xref:_domain_object_container[`DomainObjectContainer`] so that you can raise translatable info, warning and error messages; each of the relevant methods are overloaded.

For example:

[source,java]
----
public interface DomainObjectContainer {
    void informUser(String message);
    void informUser(
        TranslatableMessage message,
        final Class<?> contextClass, final String contextMethod); // <1>
    ...
}
----
<1> are concatenated together to form the context for the `.pot` file.


=== `TranslatableException`

Another mechanism by which messages can be rendered to the user are as the result of exception messages thrown and recognized by an xref:_exception_recognizer[`ExceptionRecognizer`].

In this case, if the exception implements `TranslatableException`, then the message will automatically be translated before being rendered.  The `TranslatableException` itself takes the form:

[source,java]
----
public interface TranslatableException {
    TranslatableString getTranslatableMessage(); // <1>
    String getTranslationContext();              // <2>
}

----
<1> the message to translate.  If returns `null`, then the `Exception#getMessage()` is used as a fallback
<2> the context to use when translating the message





== Integration Testing

So much for the API; but as noted, it is also necessary to ensure that the required translations are recorded (by the `TranslationService`) into the `.pot` file.

For this, we recommend that you ensure that all such methods are tested through an xref:_integration_test_support[integration test] (not unit test).

For example, here's the corresponding integration test for the "Exclamation mark" example from the simpleapp (above):

[source,java]
----
@Rule
public ExpectedException expectedException = ExpectedException.none();

@Inject
FixtureScripts fixtureScripts;

@Test
public void failsValidation() throws Exception {
    // given
    RecreateSimpleObjects fs = new RecreateSimpleObjects().setNumber(1);
    fixtureScripts.runFixtureScript(fs, null);
    SimpleObject simpleObjectWrapped = wrap(fs.getSimpleObjects().get(0));

    // expect
    expectedExceptions.expect(InvalidException.class);
    expectedExceptions.expectMessage("Exclamation mark is not allowed");

    // when
    simpleObjectWrapped.updateName("new name!");
}
----

Running this test will result in the framework calling the `validateUpdateName(...)` method, and thus to record that a translation is required in the `.pot` file.

When the integration tests are complete (that is, when Isis is shutdown), the `TranslationServicePo` will write out all captured translations to its log (more on this below). This will include all the translations captured from the Isis metamodel, along with all translations as exercised by the integration tests.

To ensure your app is fully internationalized app, you must therefore:

* use `TranslatableString` rather than `String` for all validation/disable and title methods.
* ensure that (at a minimum) all validation messages and title methods are integration tested.

[NOTE]
====
We make no apologies for this requirement: one of the reasons that we decided to implement Isis' i18n support in this way is because it encourages/requires the app to be properly tested.

Behind the scenes Isis uses a JUnit rule (`ExceptionRecognizerTranslate`) to intercept any exceptions that are thrown.  These are simply passed through to the registered xref:_exception_recognizer[``ExceptionRecognizer``]s so that any messages are recorded as requiring translation.
====




== Configuration

There are several different aspects of the translation service that can be configured.

=== Logging

To configure the `TranslationServicePo` to write to out the `translations.pot` file, add the following to the _integtests_ `logging.properties` file:

[source,ini]
----
log4j.appender.translations-po=org.apache.log4j.FileAppender
log4j.appender.translations-po.File=./translations.pot
log4j.appender.translations-po.Append=false
log4j.appender.translations-po.layout=org.apache.log4j.PatternLayout
log4j.appender.translations-po.layout.ConversionPattern=%m%n

log4j.logger.org.apache.isis.core.runtime.services.i18n.po.PoWriter=INFO,translations-po
log4j.additivity.org.apache.isis.core.runtime.services.i18n.po.PotWriter=false
----

Just to repeat, this is _not_ the `WEB-INF/logging.properties` file, it should instead be added to the `integtests/logging.properties` file.

=== Location of the `.po` files

The default location of the translated `.po` files is in the `WEB-INF` directory. These are named and searched for similarly to regular Java resource bundles.

For example, assuming these translations:

[source,ini]
----
/WEB-INF/translations-en-US.po
        /translations-en.po
        /translations-fr-FR.po
        /translations.po
----

then:

* a user with `en-US` locale will use `translations-en-US.po`
* a user with `en-GB` locale will use `translations-en.po`
* a user with `fr-FR` locale will use `translations-fr-FR.po`
* a user with `fr-CA` locale will use `translations.po`

The basename for translation files is always `translations`; this cannot be altered.


=== Externalized translation files

Normally Isis configuration files are read from the `WEB-INF` file. However, Isis can be configured to read config files from an link:../reference/externalized-configuration.html[external directory]; this is also supported for translations.

Thus, if in `web.xml` the external configuration directory has been set:

[source,xml]
----
<context-param>
    <param-name>isis.config.dir</param-name>
    <param-value>location of external config directory</param-value>
</context-param>
----

Then this directory will be used as the base for searching for translations (rather than the default 'WEB-INF/' directory).

=== Force read mode

As noted above, if running in prototype mode then `TranslationServicePo` will be in write mode, if in production mode then will be in read mode. To force read mode (ie use translations) even if in prototype mode, add the following configuration property to `isis.properties`:

[source]
----
isis.services.translation.po.mode=read
----

== Supporting services

The `TranslationServicePo` has a number of supporting/related services.

=== `LocaleProvider`

The `LocaleProvider` API is used by the `TranslationServicePo` implementation to obtain the locale of the "current user".

A default implementation is provided by the Wicket viewer.

[NOTE]
====
Note that this default implementation does not support requests made through the Restful Objects viewer (there is no Wicket 'application' object available); the upshot is that requests through Restful Objects are never translated. Registering a different implementation of `LocaleProvider` that taps into appropriate REST (RestEasy?) APIs would be the way to address this.
====


=== `TranslationsResolver`

The `TranslationResolver` is used by the `TranslationService` implementation to lookup translations for a specified locale. It is this service that reads from the `WEB-INF/` (or externalized directory).


=== `TranslationServicePoMenu`

The `TranslationServicePoMenu` provides a couple of menu actions in the UI (prototype mode only) that interacts with the underlying `TranslationServicePo`:

* the `downloadTranslationsFile()` action - available only in write mode - allows the current `.pot` file to be downloaded. +
+
[NOTE]
====
While this will contain all the translations from the metamodel, it will not necessarily contain all translations for all imperative methods returning `TranslatableString` instances; which are present and which are missing will depend on which imperative methods have been called (recorded by the service) prior to downloading.
====

* the `clearTranslationsCache()` action - available only in read mode - will clear the cache so that new translations can be loaded. +
+
This allows a translator to edit the appropriate `translations-xx-XX.po` file and check the translation is correct without having to restart the app.




== Migrating from v1.6.0 to 1.7.0

In v1.7.0 we've continued the work started in link:migrating-to-1.6.0.html[1.6.0] in modularizing the framework. The most important change to note is that all Isis core modules (with the Maven `groupId` of `org.apache.isis.module` have now MOVED to [http://www.isisaddons.org](Isis Addons).

In addition, we've retired some obsolete (and unused) functionality, specifically the `ProfileStore` component.

To move up amounts to changing POM files and, where required, updating package names for any referenced modules.

=== Reorganized 'modules'

The following modules are no longer released as part of Isis core and have moved to Isis Addons (or in one case, back into Isis core).

Minor changes are required to `pom.xml` files and (in some cases) to `isis.properties` config file.

In one or two exceptional cases it may be necessary to fix up import statements if there are reference to changed package/class names in code (most likely any dependency on the `devutils` module or `settings` module).

==== Audit module

In `pom.xml`, replace:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.isis.module</groupId>
    <artifactId>isis-module-audit-jdo</artifactId>

or to:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.isis.module</groupId>
    <artifactId>isis-module-devutils-impl</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

These modules are no longer required (the `org.apache.isis.module:isis-module-devutils-applib`
and `org.apache.isis.module:isis-module-devutils-impl` submodules have been combined
into the new `org.isisaddons.module.devutils:isis-module-devutils-dom` module).

If necessary, also update any services registered in `isis.properties` (package/class names may have changed slightly).

==== Publishing module

In `pom.xml`, replace:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.isis.module</groupId>

If necessary, also update any services registered in `isis.properties` (package/class names may have changed slightly).

==== Publishing Event Serializer RO module

Remove any references to:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.isis.module</groupId>
    <artifactId>isis-module-publishingeventserializer-ro</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

This module has been merged with `org.isisaddons.module.publishing:isis-module-publishing-dom`, above.

==== Settings module

In `pom.xml`, replace:

[source,xml]

----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.isis.module</groupId>
    <artifactId>isis-module-settings</artifactId>
</dependency>

or to:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.isis.module</groupId>
    <artifactId>isis-module-settings-impl</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

These modules are no longer required (the `org.apache.isis.module:isis-module-settings-applib`
and `org.apache.isis.module:isis-module-settings-impl` submodules have been combined
into the new `org.isisaddons.module.settings:isis-module-settings-dom` module).

If necessary, also update any services registered in `isis.properties` (package/class names may have changed slightly).

==== Background module

In `pom.xml`, remove:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.isis.module</groupId>
    <artifactId>isis-module-background</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

The service classes have been moved into existing `org.apache.isis.core:isis-core-runtime` Maven module (that is, already be referenced in the `pom.xml`).

If necessary, also update any services registered in `isis.properties` (package/class names may have changed slightly).

=== Retired `ProfileStore` component

As per <a href='https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ISIS-802'>ISIS-802</a>, the ProfileStore component has been removed. This functionality was not surfaced or available in the Wicket or Restful Objects viewers, so there is no meaningful loss of functionality. However, Maven `pom.xml` files will require updating:

Specifically, remove any dependencies on `org.apache.isis:isis-core-profilestore`:

[source]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.isis.core</groupId>
    <artifactId>isis-core-profilestore</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

A number of corresponding classes/interfaces have also been removed from the Isis applib:

* `org.apache.isis.applib.fixtures.userprofile.UserProfileService`
* `org.apache.isis.applib.fixtures.userprofile.UserProfileServiceAware`
* `org.apache.isis.applib.fixtures.UserProfileFixture`
* `org.apache.isis.applib.profiles.Profile`
* `org.apache.isis.applib.profiles.Perspective`

It is highly unlikely that any existing production code references these classes.
