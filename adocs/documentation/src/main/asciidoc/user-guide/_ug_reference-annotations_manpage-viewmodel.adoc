Title: @ViewModel

The `@ViewModel` annotation, applied to a class, is the simplest way to indicate that the class is a view model.
View models are not persisted to the database, instead their state is encoded within their identity (ultimately
represented in the URL). As such, view models are immutable.

For example:

[source]
----
@ViewModel
public class MyViewModel {

    public MyViewModel() {}

    ...

}
----

View models must have a no-arg constructor, but there are few other constraints.

* if the view model has dependencies on domain services, then either:
* instantiate using `DomainObjectContainer#newTransientInstance()` or
* instantiate directly and then inject explicitly using `DomainObjectContainer#injectServicesInto(.)`
* if the view model has no dependencies on domain services, then just instantiate directly

____

Note that there is a `DomainObjectContainer#newViewModelInstance(.)`; this is for view models that implement `ViewModel` interface and can be safely ignored.

____

The view model's memento will be derived from the value of the view model object's properties. Any http://isis.apache.org/reference/recognized-annotations/NotPersistent.html[@NotPersistent] properties will be excluded from the memento, as will any http://isis.apache.org/reference/recognized-annotations/Programmatic.html[@Programmatic] properties. Properties that are merely http://isis.apache.org/reference/recognized-annotations/Hidden-deprecated.html[@Hidden] are included in the memento.

Only properties supported by the configured link:../reference/services/memento-service.html[MementoService] can be used. The default implementation supports all the value types and persisted entities.

(As of 1.8.0) there are some limitations:
* view models cannot hold collections other view models (simple properties _are_ supported, though)
* collections (of either view models or entities) are ignored.

Title: @Disabled

____

Deprecated, use instead link:./Property.html[@Property#editing()], link:./Collection.html[@Collection#editing()], and also link:./DomainObject.html[@DomainObject#editing()]

*Support*

* Fully supported by: Wicket viewer; other viewers do not yet support the `where` attribute.

____

The `@Disabled` annotation means that the member cannot be used in any
instance of the class. When applied to the property it means that the
user may not modify the value of that property (though it may still be
modified programmatically). When applied to an action method, it means
that the user cannot invoke that method.

For example:

[source]
----
public class Customer {
    @Disabled
    public void assessCreditWorthiness() { ... }

    @Disabled
    public int getInitialCreditRating(){ ... }
    public void setInitialCreditRating(int initialCreditRating) { ... }
}
----

Note that if an action is marked as `@Disabled`, it will be shown on the
user interface but cannot ever be invoked. The only possible reason we
can think to do this is during prototyping, to indicate an action that
is still to be developed. If a method is intended for programmatic use,
but not intended ever to be invoked directly by a user, then it should
be marked as `@Hidden` instead.

This annotation can also take two parameter indicating where (in the UI)
it is to be disabled, and when (in the object's lifecycle) it is to be
disabled. For example:

[source]
----
public class Customer {
    (when=When.UNTIL_PERSISTED)
    public void assessCreditWorthiness() { ... }
}
----

would disable the action until the object has been saved. And:

[source]
----
public class Customer {
    (where=Where.PARENTED_TABLES)
    public void getFirstName() { ... }
}
----

would disable the property in parented tables but not in regular object
forms (though note: this would only be used by viewers that provide
in-table editing capability).

The acceptable values for the `where` parameter are:

* `Where.ANYWHERE` +
+
The member should be disabled everywhere.

* `Where.OBJECT_FORMS` +
+
The member should be disabled when displayed within an object form.
For most viewers, this applies to property and collection members,
not actions.

* `Where.PARENTED_TABLES` +
+
The member should be disabled when displayed as a column of a table
within a parent object's collection. For most (all?) viewers, this
will have meaning only if applied to a property member.

* `Where.STANDALONE_TABLES` +
+
The member should be disabled when displayed as a column of a table
showing a standalone list of objects, for example as returned by a
repository query. For most (all?) viewers, this will have meaning
only if applied to a property member.

* `Where.ALL_TABLES` +
+
The member should be disabled when displayed as a column of a table,
either an object's * collection or a standalone list. This combines
`PARENTED_TABLES` and `STANDALONE_TABLES`

* `Where.NOWHERE` +
+
Has no meaning for the `@Disabled` annotation (though is used by the
`@Hidden` annotation which also uses the `Where` enum<!--, see ?-->).

The acceptable values for the `when` parameter are:

* `When.ALWAYS` +
+
The member should be disabled at all times.

* `When.NEVER` +
+
The member should never be disabled (unless disabled through some
other mechanism, for example an imperative disableXxx() supporting
method)..

* `When.ONCE_PERSISTED` +
+
The member should be enabled for transient objects, but disabled for
persisted objects.

* `When.UNTIL_PERSISTED` +
+
The member should be disabled for transient objects, but enabled for
persisted objects.

By default the annotated property or action is always disabled (ie
defaults to `Where.ANYWHERE`, `When.ALWAYS`).
