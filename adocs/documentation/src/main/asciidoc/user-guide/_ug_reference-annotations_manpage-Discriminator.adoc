IMPORTANT: TODO - @javax.jdo.annotation.Discriminator



[IMPORTANT]
====
If the object type has not been specified (by either this annotation, or by xref:_ug_reference-annotations_manpage-PersistenceCapable[`@PersistenceCapable`], or by Isis' own xref:_ug_reference-annotations_manpage-ObjectType[`@ObjectType`] annotation), then Isis will use the fully qualified class name of the entity.

However, chances are that the fully qualified class name is liable to change over time, for example if the code is refactored or (more fundamentally) if your company/organization reorganizes/renames itself/is acquired.

We therefore strongly recommend that you specify an object type for all entities, one way or another.  Specifying `@Discriminator` will override `@PersistenceCapable`, which in turn (so long as both `schema()` attribute was specified) overrides `ObjectType`.
