The `@CollectionLayout` annotation applies to collections, collecting together all UI hints within a single
annotation.  It is also possible to apply the annotation to actions of domain services that are acting as contributed collections.

The table below summarizes the annotation's attributes.

For example:

[source,java]
----
public class ToDoItem {

    @CollectionLayout(
        cssClass="x-key",
        named="Todo items that are <i>dependencies</i> of this item.",
        namedEscaped=false,
        describedAs="Other todo items that must be completed before this one",
        labelPosition=LabelPosition.LEFT,
        render=EAGERLY
        typicalLength=80)
    public SortedSet<ToDoItem> getDependencies() { ... }

    ...
}
----







== anchor:reference-annotations_manpage-CollectionLayout[]`cssClass()`

IMPORTANT: WIP ... this section


The `CssClass` annotation applies to object and also to any object member
(property, collection or action). It is used by the Wicket viewer as a UI hint
to render specified CSS classes around the representation of the element.

Application-specific CSS can then be used to target and adjust the UI representation
of that particular element.

For example:

[source,java]
----
@CssClass("x-main")
public class ToDoItem { ... }
----

or

[source,java]
----
public class ToDoItem {

    @CssClass("x-key")
    public LocalDate getDueBy() { ... }

}
----

=== Alternatives (`.layout.json`)

As an alternative to using the `@CssClass` annotation, the `.layout.json`
link:../../components/viewers/wicket/dynamic-layouts.html[dynamic layout file]
can be specified, eg:

[source,javascript]
----
{
    "span": 6,
    "memberGroups": {
        "Priority": {
            "members": {
                ...
                "dueBy": {
                    "cssClass": { "value": "x-key" }
                }
                ....
            }
        },
        ...
    }
}
----

Note that this (currently) only supports class members, not classes


[NOTE]
====
The similar link:./CssClassFa-deprecated.html[CssClassFa] annotation is also used as a hint to apply CSS, but in particular to allow http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/icons/[Font Awesome icons] to be rendered on action butotns or as the icon for classes.

== anchor:reference-annotations_manpage-CollectionLayout[]`describedAs()`

IMPORTANT: WIP ... this section

The `@DescribedAs` annotation is used to provide a short description of
something that features on the user interface. How this description is
used will depend upon the viewing mechanism - but it may be thought of
as being like a 'tool tip'.

Descriptions may be provided for objects, members (properties,
collections and actions), and for individual parameters within an action
method. `@DescribedAs` therefore works in a very similar manner to
`@Named` <!--(see ?)-->.



For example:

[source,java]
----
public class Customer {
    @DescribedAs("The name that the customer has indicated that they wish to be " +
                 "addressed as (e.g. Johnny rather than Jonathan)")
    public String getFirstName() { ... }
}
----




== anchor:reference-annotations_manpage-CollectionLayout[]`hidden()`

IMPORTANT: WIP ... this section


The `@Hidden` annotation indicates that the member (property, collection
or action) to which it is applied should never be visible to the user.
It can also be applied to service types (it has no effect if applied to
entities or values).

For example:

[source,java]
----
public class Customer {
    @Hidden
    public int getInternalId() { ... }

    @Hidden
    public void updateStatus() { ... }
    ...
}
----

Or, applied to a service:

[source,java]
----
@Hidden
public class EmailService {
    public void sendEmail(...) { ... }
    ...
}
----

This annotation can also take a parameters indicating where and when it
is to be hidden. For example:

[source,java]
----
public class Customer {
    @Hidden(when=When.ONCE_PERSISTED)
    public int getInternalId() { ... }
    ...
}
----

would show the `Id` until the object has been saved, and then would hide
it. And:

[source,java]
----
public class Customer {
    @Hidden(where=Where.ALL_TABLES)
    public int getDateOfBirth() { ... }
    ...
}
----

would suppress the `dateOfBirth` property of a Customer from all tables.

The acceptable values for the `where` parameter are:

* `Where.ANYWHERE` +
+
The member should be hidden everywhere.

* `Where.OBJECT_FORMS` +
+
The member should be hidden when displayed within an object form.
For most viewers, this applies to property and collection members,
not actions.

* `Where.PARENTED_TABLES` +
+
The member should be hidden when displayed as a column of a table
within a parent object's collection. For most (all?) viewers, this
will have meaning only if applied to a property member.

* `Where.STANDALONE_TABLES` +
+
The member should be hidden when displayed as a column of a table
showing a standalone list of objects, for example as returned by a
repository query. For most (all?) viewers, this will have meaning
only if applied to a property member.

* `Where.ALL_TABLES` +
+
The member should be /hidden when displayed as a column of a table,
either an object's * collection or a standalone list. This combines
`PARENTED_TABLES` and `STANDALONE_TABLES`.

* `Where.NOWHERE` +
+
Acts as an override if a member would normally be hidden as a result
of some other convention. For example, if a property is annotated
with `@Title` <!--(see ?)-->, then normally this should be hidden from all
tables. Additionally annotating with `@Hidden(where=Where.NOWHERE)`
overrides this.

The acceptable values for the `when` parameter are:

* `When.ALWAYS` +
+
The member should be hidden at all times.

* `When.NEVER` +
+
The member should never be hidden (unless disabled through some
other mechanism, for example an imperative disableXxx() supporting
method)..

* `When.ONCE_PERSISTED` +
+
The member should be visible for transient objects, but hidden for
persisted objects.

* `When.UNTIL_PERSISTED` +
+
The member should be hidden for transient objects, but visible for
persisted objects.

By default the annotated property or action is always hidden (ie
defaults to `Where.ANYWHERE`, `When.ALWAYS`).








== anchor:reference-annotations_manpage-CollectionLayout[]Named

By default, the name of a class member (a property, collection or action) presented to the user is derived, reflectively, from the name of the member defined in the program code. To specify a different name use the `@Named `annotation immediately before the member declaration.

[TIP]
====
Generally speaking it is better to rename the property, collection or action. The only common case where `@Named` is common is to rename parameters for built-in value types. Even here though a custom value type can be defined using `@Value` so that the value type is used as the parameter name. `@Named` may also be used if the name needs punctuation or other symbols in the name presented to the user.
====



=== named()

IMPORTANT: WIP ... this section


The `@Named` annotation is used when you want to specify the way
something is named on the user interface i.e. when you do not want to
use the name generated automatically by the system. It can be applied to
objects, members (properties, collections, and actions) and to
parameters within an action method.



For example:

[source,java]
----
public class Customer {

    public String getFirstName() { ... }

    public String getSurname() { ... }

    public CreditRating getCreditRating() { ... }
}
----

Note that the framework provides a separate and more powerful mechanism
for internationalisation.


=== namedEscaped()

IMPORTANT: WIP ... this section







== anchor:reference-annotations_manpage-CollectionLayout[]`paged()`

IMPORTANT: WIP ... this section


This annotation is used to indicate that parented and/or standalone
collections should be paginated.

When annotated on a collection, `@Paged` indicates the page size of a
parented collection. When annotated on a type, `@Paged` indicates the page
size of a standalone collection.

For example:

[source,java]
----
@Paged(30)
public class Order {

    @Paged(15)
    public List<LineItem> getDetails() {...}
}
----

This indicates a page size of 15 for parented collections, and a page
size of 30 for standalone collections.

When omitting a parameter value or omitting the annotation completely,
the configured defaults in `isis.properties` will be used.

For example:

[source,ini]
----
isis.viewers.paged.standalone=20
isis.viewers.paged.parented=5
----

This indicates a page size of 5 for parented collections and a page size
of 20 for standalone collections.









== anchor:reference-annotations_manpage-CollectionLayout[]`render()`

IMPORTANT: WIP ... this section


The `@Render` annotation is a hint for properties and collections to
indicate that a value property should be rendered lazily (rather than
eagerly, as usual), or that a reference property or collection should be
rendered eagerly (rather than lazily, as usual).

Viewers can use this to present the property/collection in an
appropriate manner:

*

an `Order`'s `lineItems` collection might initially be rendered expanded
form so that the user could see a list of line items immediately
when the order is rendered. This is the most common use case.

*

a (reference) property of type `Address` might show the details of the
referenced `Address` in a box

At the same time, an object store might use this to defer lazy loading
of values that represent blobs or clobs.

For example:

[source,java]
----
public class Order {
    @Render(Type.EAGERLY)
    public List<LineItem> getDetails() { ... }

    ...
}
----

For properties and collections there is some similarity between this
concept and that of eager-loading as supported by some object stores.
Indeed, some object stores may choose use their own specific annotations
(eg a JDO default fetch group) in order to infer this semantic.







== anchor:reference-annotations_manpage-CollectionLayout[]`sortedBy()`

IMPORTANT: WIP ... this section


The `@SortedBy` annotation is an instruction hint for (`SortedSet`) collections to use the specified comparator rather than the natural ordering of the entity
(as would usually be the case).

For example, this is taken from the Isis addons example https://github.com/isisaddons/isis-app-todoapp/[todoapp] (not ASF):

[source,java]
----
public class ToDoItem implements Comparable<ToDoItem> {

    ...
    public static class DependenciesComparator implements Comparator<ToDoItem> {
        @Override
        public int compare(ToDoItem p, ToDoItem q) {
            return ORDERING_BY_DESCRIPTION
                    .compound(Ordering.<ToDoItem>natural())
                    .compare(p, q);
        }
    }

    ...
    @SortedBy(DependenciesComparator.class)
    public SortedSet<ToDoItem> getDependencies() { ... }

    public int compareTo(final ToDoItem other) {
        return ORDERING_BY_COMPLETE
                .compound(ORDERING_BY_DUE_BY)
                .compound(ORDERING_BY_DESCRIPTION)
                .compare(this, other);
    }
    ...
}
----

When the `dependencies` collection is rendered, the elements are sorted by the `description` property first:

![](images/sortedby-dependencies.png)

Without this annotation, the order would have been inverted (because the natural ordering places items not completed before those items that have been completed.
