Apache Isis uses JDO/DataNucleus as its ORM, and infers some of its own metadata from the JDO annotations.

[WARNING]
====
Isis (currently) builds up metadata by parsing the JDO annotations from source, _not_ by querying the JDO metamodel.  The upshot is that, for the annotations documented here at least, your domain entities must use JDO annotations rather than XML.
====

The table below lists the JDO annotations currently recognized by Isis.


.JDO Annotations

|Annotation
|Purpose
|Layer

`Discriminator`]
|Override for the object type, as used in `Bookmark`s, URLs for xref:_ug_restfulobjects-viewer[RestfulObjects viewer] and elsewhere. +

Note that the discriminator overrides the object type that may otherwise be inferred from the xref:_ug_reference-annotations_manpage-PersistenceCapable[`@PersistenceCapable`] annotation.

`PersistenceCapable`]
|Used to build Isis' own internal identifier for objects. +

If both `schema()` and `table()` are specified (and if xref:_ug_reference-annotations_manpage-Discriminator[`@Discriminator`] _hasn't_ been specified), is also used to derive the object type, as used in `Bookmark`s, URLs for xref:_ug_restfulobjects-viewer[RestfulObjects viewer] and elsewhere.

Isis also parses the following JDO annotations, but the metadata is currently unused.
