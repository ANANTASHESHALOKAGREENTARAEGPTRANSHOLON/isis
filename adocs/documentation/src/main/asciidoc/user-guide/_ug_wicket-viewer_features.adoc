This section discusses features of the wicket viewer from the perspective of an end-user actually using your Isis application.



== Titles in Tables

Object titles can often be quite long if the intention is to uniquely identify the object.  While this is appropriate for the object view, it can be cumbersome within tables.

If an object's title is specified with from `@Title` annotation then the Wicket viewer will (for parented collections) automatically "contextualize" a title by excluding the part of the title corresponding to a reference to the owning (parent) object.

In other words, suppose we have:

image::{_imagesdir}how-tos/ui-hints/object-titles-and-icons/cust-order-product.png[width="579px",link="{_imagesdir}how-tos/ui-hints/object-titles-and-icons/cust-order-product.png"]

so that `Customer` has a collection of `Order`s:

[source,java]
----
public class Customer {
    public Set<Order> getOrders() { ... }
    ...
}
----

and `Product` also has a collection of `Order`s (please forgive the suspect domain modelling in this example (!)):

[source,java]
----
public class Product {
    public Set<Order> getOrders() { ... }
    ...
}
----

and where the `Order` class references both `Customer` and `Product`.

The `Order`'s might involve each of these:

[source,java]
----
public class Order {
    @Title(sequence="1")
    public Customer getCustomer() { ... }
    @Title(sequence="2")
    public Product getProduct() { ... }
    @Title(sequence="3")
    public String getOtherInfo() { ... }
    ...
}
----

In this case, if we view a `Customer` with its collection of `Order`s, then in that parented collection's table the customer's property will be automatically excluded from the title of the `Order` (but it would show the product).  Conversely, if a `Product` is viewed then its collection of `Order`s would suppress product (but would show the customer).

[TIP]
====
This feature is a close cousin of the `@PropertyLayout(hidden=Where.REFERENCES_PARENT)` annotation, which will cause the property itself to be hidden as a column in the table. An Isis idiom is therefore:

[source,java]
----
public class Order {
    @Title(sequence="1")
    @PropertyLayout(hidden=Where.REFERENCES_PARENT)
    public Customer getCustomer() { ... }
    ...
}
----

====

The above annotations mean that titles usually "just work", altering according to the context in which they are viewed.

[TIP]
====
It is also possible to configure the Wicket viewer to xref:_abbreviating_suppressing_titles_in_tables[abbreviate titles or suppress them] completely.
====



== File upload/download

The Isis application library provides the xref:_blob[Blob] value type (binary large objects) and also the xref:_clob[Clob]
value type (character large object), each of which also includes metadata about the data (specifically the filename and mime type).

A class can define a property using either of these types, for example:

=== Screenshots

The following screenshots are taken from the Isis addons example https://github.com/isisaddons/isis-app-todoapp[todoapp] (not ASF):

==== View mode, empty

`Blob` field rendered as attachment (with no data):

image::{_imagesdir}wicket-viewer/file-upload-download/010-attachment-field-940.png[width="800px",link="{_imagesdir}wicket-viewer/file-upload-download/010-attachment-field.png"]

==== Edit mode

Hit edit; 'choose file' button appears:

image::{_imagesdir}wicket-viewer/file-upload-download/020-edit-choose-file-940.png[width="800px",link="{_imagesdir}wicket-viewer/file-upload-download/020-edit-choose-file.png"]

==== Choose file

Choose file using the regular browser window:

image::{_imagesdir}wicket-viewer/file-upload-download/030-choose-file-using-browser-520.png[width="520px",link="{_imagesdir}wicket-viewer/file-upload-download/030-choose-file-using-browser.png"]


Chosen file is indicated:

image::{_imagesdir}wicket-viewer/file-upload-download/040-edit-chosen-file-indicated-940.png[width="800px",link="{_imagesdir}wicket-viewer/file-upload-download/040-edit-chosen-file-indicated.png"]

==== Image rendered

Back in view mode (ie once hit OK) if the `Blob` is an image, then it is shown:

image::{_imagesdir}wicket-viewer/file-upload-download/050-ok-if-image-then-rendered-940.png[width="800px",link="{_imagesdir}wicket-viewer/file-upload-download/050-ok-if-image-then-rendered.png"]

==== Download

`Blob` can be downloaded:

image::{_imagesdir}wicket-viewer/file-upload-download/060-download-940.png[width="800px",link="{_imagesdir}wicket-viewer/file-upload-download/060-download.png"]

==== Clear

Back in edit mode, can choose a different file or clear (assuming property is not mandatory):

image::{_imagesdir}wicket-viewer/file-upload-download/070-edit-clear-940.png[width="800px",link="{_imagesdir}wicket-viewer/file-upload-download/070-edit-clear.png"]

=== Domain Code

To define a `Blob`, use:

[source,java]
----
private Blob attachment;
@javax.jdo.annotations.Persistent(defaultFetchGroup="false")
    @javax.jdo.annotations.Persistent(defaultFetchGroup="false", columns = {
            @javax.jdo.annotations.Column(name = "attachment_name"),
            @javax.jdo.annotations.Column(name = "attachment_mimetype"),
            @javax.jdo.annotations.Column(name = "attachment_bytes", jdbcType = "BLOB", sqlType = "BLOB")
    })
@Property(
        domainEvent = AttachmentDomainEvent.class,
        optionality = Optionality.OPTIONAL
)
public Blob getAttachment() { return attachment; }
public void setAttachment(final Blob attachment) { this.attachment = attachment; }
----

To define a `Clob`, use:

[source,java]
----
private Clob doc;
@javax.jdo.annotations.Persistent(defaultFetchGroup="false", columns = {
        @javax.jdo.annotations.Column(name = "doc_name"),
        @javax.jdo.annotations.Column(name = "doc_mimetype"),
        @javax.jdo.annotations.Column(name = "doc_chars", jdbcType = "CLOB", sqlType = "CLOB")
})
@Property(
        optionality = Optionality.OPTIONAL
)
public Clob getDoc() { return doc; }
public void setDoc(final Clob doc) { this.doc = doc; }
----

The `Blob` and `Clob` types can also be used as parameters to actions.




== Bookmarked pages

The Wicket viewer supports the bookmarking of both domain objects and query-only (xref:_actionsemantics[@ActionSemantics]) actions.

Domain objects, if bookmarkable, can be nested.

Bookmarking is automatic; whenever a bookmarkable object/action is visited, then a bookmark is created. To avoid the number of bookmarks from indefinitely growing, bookmarks that have not been followed after a whle are automatically removed (an MRU/LRU algorithm). The number of bookmarks to preserve can be configured.

=== Screenshots

The following screenshot, taken from https://github.com/isisaddons/isis-app-todoapp[Isisaddons example todoapp] (not ASF) shows how the bookmarks are listed in a sliding panel.

image::{_imagesdir}wicket-viewer/bookmarked-pages/panel.png[width="800px",link="{_imagesdir}wicket-viewer/bookmarked-pages/panel.png"]

[NOTE]
====
TODO: this screenshot need to be updated for the new look-n-feel introduced in 1.8.0
====

Note how the list contains both domain objects and an action ("not yet complete").

Bookmarks can also form a hierarchy.  The following screenshot, also taken from the https://github.com/estatio/estatio[Estatio] application, shows a variety of different bookmarked objects with a nested structure:

image::{_imagesdir}wicket-viewer/bookmarked-pages/panel-estatio.png[width="800px",link="{_imagesdir}wicket-viewer/bookmarked-pages/panel-estatio.png"]

[NOTE]
====
TODO: this screenshot need to be updated for the new look-n-feel introduced in 1.8.0
====

Some - like `Property`, `Lease` and `Party` - are root nodes. However, `LeaseItem` is bookmarkable as a child of `Lease`, and `LeaseTerm` is bookmarkable only as a child of `LeaseItem`. This parent/child relationship is reflected in the layout.

=== Domain Code

To indicate a class is bookmarkable, use the xref:_domainobjectlayout[@DomainObjectLayout] annotation:

[source,java]
----
@DomainObjectLayout(
    bookmarking=BookmarkPolicy.AS_ROOT
)
public class Lease { ... }
----

To indicate a class is bookmarkable but only as a child of some parent bookmark, specify the bookmark policy:

[source,java]
----
@DomainObjectLayout(
    bookmarking=BookmarkPolicy.AS_CHILD
)
public class LeaseItem { ... }
----

To indicate that a safe (query only) action is bookmarkable, use the xref:_actionlayout[@ActionLayout] annotation:

[source,java]
----
public class ToDoItem ... {
    ...
    @ActionLayout(
         bookmarking=BookmarkPolicy.AS_ROOT
     )
    @ActionSemantics(Of.SAFE)
    public List<ToDoItem> notYetComplete() { ... }
    ...
}
----

[NOTE]
====
The BookmarkPolicy.AS_CHILD does not have a meaning for actions; if the `bookmarking` attribute is set to any other value, it will be ignored.
====

=== User Experience

The sliding panel appears whenever the mouse pointer hovers over the thin blue tab (to the left of the top header region).

Alternatively, `alt+[` will toggle open/close the panel; it can also be closed using `Esc` key.

=== Related functionality

The xref:_recent_pages[Recent Pages] also lists recently visited pages, selected from a drop-down.

=== Configuration

By default, the bookmarked pages panel will show a maximum of 15 'root' pages. This can be overridden using a property (in `isis.properties`), for example:

[source,ini]
----
isis.viewer.wicket.bookmarkedPages.maxSize=20
----



== Recent pages (drop down)

The Wicket viewer provides a recent pages drop-down that acts as a breadcrumb trail. Using it, the user can quickly open a recently accessed domain object.

=== Screenshots

The following screenshot, taken from the https://github.com/estatio/estatio[Estatio] application, shows the recent pages drop-down after a number of pages have been accessed.

image::{_imagesdir}wicket-viewer/recent-pages/recent-pages.png[width="800px",link="{_imagesdir}wicket-viewer/recent-pages/recent-pages.png"]


[NOTE]
====
TODO: this screenshot need to be updated for the new look-n-feel introduced in 1.8.0
====

=== Domain Code

The recent pages drop-down is automatically populated; no changes need to be made to the domain classes.

=== User Experience

Selecting the domain object from the list causes the viewer to automatically navigate to the page for the selected object.

=== Related functionality

The xref:_bookmarked_pages[bookmarked pages] (sliding panel) also provides links to recently visited objects, but only those explicitly marked as `@DomainObject(bookmarking=...)`.  The bookmarks panel also nests related objects together hierarchically (the recent pages drop-down does not).

=== Configuration

The number of objects is hard-coded as 10; it cannot currently be configured.





== Hints and copy URL

While the user can often copy the URL of a domain object directly from the browser's address bar, the Wicket viewer also allows the URL of domain objects to be easily copied from a dialog.

More interestingly, this URL can also contain hints capturing any sorting or page numbering, or hiding/viewing of collections.  End-users can therefore share these URLs as a form of deep linking into a particular view on a domain object.

The copy URL and hinting is automatic.

=== Screenshots

The following screenshots are taken from the [Estatio](https://github.com/estatio/estatio) application.

[NOTE]
====
TODO: these screenshots need to be updated for the new look-n-feel introduced in 1.8.0
====

==== Copy URL

This screenshot shows the copy URL button (top right):

image::{_imagesdir}wicket-viewer/copy-link/010-copy-link-button.png[width="800px",link="{_imagesdir}wicket-viewer/copy-link/010-copy-link-button.png"]

Clicking on this button brings up a dialog with the URL preselected:

image::{_imagesdir}wicket-viewer/copy-link/020-copy-link-dialog.png[width="800px",link="{_imagesdir}wicket-viewer/copy-link/020-copy-link-dialog.png"]


The URL in this case is something like:

    http://localhost:8080/wicket/entity/org.estatio.dom.lease.Lease:0

The user can copy the link (eg `ctrl+C`) into the clipboard, then hit `OK` or `Esc` to dismiss the dialog.

==== Hints

Using the viewer the user can hide/show collection tables, can sort the tables by header columns:

image::{_imagesdir}wicket-viewer/copy-link/030-hints.png[width="800px",link="{_imagesdir}wicket-viewer/copy-link/030-hints.png"]


Also, if the collection spans multiple pages, then the individual page can be selected.

Once the view has been customised, the URL shown in the copy URL dialog is in an extended form:

image::{_imagesdir}wicket-viewer/copy-link/040-copy-link-with-hints.png[width="800px",link="{_imagesdir}wicket-viewer/copy-link/040-copy-link-with-hints.png"]

The URL in this case is something like:

    http://localhost:8080/wicket/entity/org.estatio.dom.lease.Lease:0?hint-1:collectionContents-view=3&hint-1:collectionContents:collectionContents-3:table-DESCENDING=value&hint-1:collectionContents:collectionContents-3:table-pageNumber=0&hint-2:collectionContents-view=0&hint-2:collectionContents:collectionContents-2:table-pageNumber=0&hint-3:collectionContents-view=2&hint-3:collectionContents:collectionContents-2:table-pageNumber=0&hint-4:collectionContents-view=3&hint-4:collectionContents:collectionContents-3:table-ASCENDING=exerciseDate&hint-4:collectionContents:collectionContents-3:table-pageNumber=0&hint-5:collectionContents-view=0&hint-5:collectionContents:collectionContents-3:table-pageNumber=0

==== Copy URL from title

When the user invokes an action on the object, the URL (necessarily) changes to indicate that the action was invoked.  This URL is specific to the user's session and cannot be shared with others.

A quick way for the user to grab a shareable URL is simply by clicking on the object's title:

image::{_imagesdir}wicket-viewer/copy-link/050-title-url.png[width="800px",link="{_imagesdir}wicket-viewer/copy-link/050-title-url.png"]


=== User Experience

The copy URL dialog is typically obtained by clicking on the icon.

Alternatively, `alt+]` will also open the dialog.  It can be closed with either `OK` or the `Esc` key.







== User Registration

The Wicket viewer provides the ability for users to sign-up by providing a valid email address:

* from the login page the user can instead follow a link to take them to a sign-up page, where they enter their email address.
* a verification email is sent using this service; the email includes a link back to the running application.
* the user then completes the registration process by choosing a user name and password.
* the Wicket viewer then creates an account for them and logs them in.

In a similar way, if the user has forgotten their password then they can request a reset link to be sent to their email, again by providing their email address.

To support this the framework requires three services to be registered and configured:

* the xref:_user_registration_service[user registration service], which provides an API to create the user account
* the xref:_email_notification_service[email notification service], which provides an API for to send the verification emails
* the xref:_email_service[email service], that is used by the email notification service to actually send the email.

The Isis core framework provides a default implementation of both the email notification service and the email service. If your application uses the https://github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-security[Isis addons security module] (not ASF) then an implementation is provided by that module; just add to the classpath. Otherwise you will need to provide your own implementation.

[NOTE]
====
There is _no_ default implementation of the user registration service in the core framework.
====

=== Screenshots

The user is presented with a login page:

image::{_imagesdir}wicket-viewer/user-registration/login-page-default.png[width="300px",link="{_imagesdir}wicket-viewer/user-registration/login-page-default.png"]


Navigate to the sign up page. Complete the page, and verify:

image::{_imagesdir}wicket-viewer/user-registration/sign-up-page.png[width="300px",link="{_imagesdir}wicket-viewer/user-registration/sign-up-page.png"]


Back to the login page:

image::{_imagesdir}wicket-viewer/user-registration/sign-up-login-page-after-sign-up.png[width="300px",link="{_imagesdir}wicket-viewer/user-registration/sign-up-login-page-after-sign-up.png"]


Email arrives, with link:

image::{_imagesdir}wicket-viewer/user-registration/sign-up-email-with-verification-link.png[width="500px",link="{_imagesdir}wicket-viewer/user-registration/sign-up-email-with-verification-link.png"]


Follow the link, complete the page:

image::{_imagesdir}wicket-viewer/user-registration/sign-up-registration-page.png[width="300px",link="{_imagesdir}wicket-viewer/user-registration/sign-up-registration-page.png"]


Automatically logged in:

image::{_imagesdir}wicket-viewer/user-registration/sign-up-after-registration.png[width="800px",link="{_imagesdir}wicket-viewer/user-registration/sign-up-after-registration.png"]


=== Configuration

There are two prerequisites:

* register an implementation of the xref:_user_registration_service[user registration service] (eg by using the https://github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-security[Isis addons security module])

* configure the xref:_email_service[email service]

The latter is required if you are using the default email notification service and email service. If you are using your own alternative implementation of the email notification service then it may be omitted (and configure your own alternative implementation as required).

It is also possible to configure the Wicket viewer to suppress xref:_suppressing_sign_up[the sign-up page link] and/or the xref:_suppressing_password_reset[password reset page].
