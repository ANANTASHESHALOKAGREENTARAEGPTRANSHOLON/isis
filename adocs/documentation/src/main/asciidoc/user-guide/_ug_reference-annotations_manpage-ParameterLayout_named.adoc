The `@Named` annotation is used when you want to specify the way
something is named on the user interface i.e. when you do not want to
use the name generated automatically by the system. It can be applied to
objects, members (properties, collections, and actions) and to
parameters within an action method.


[TIP]
====
Following the link:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself[don't repeat yourself] principle, we recommend that you only use this attribute when the desired name cannot be used in Java source code.  Examples of that include a name that would be a reserved Java keyword (eg "package"), or a name that has punctuation, eg apostrophes.

The most common usage of `@Named` is be to specify names for the
parameters of an action. This is because the parameter name declared in
the code for the action method cannot be picked up reflectively (by
default, the user interface will use the type of the parameter as the
name; for a `String` or a `Boolean`, this is almost certainly not what is
required).

To specify the name of a parameter, the `@Named` annotation is applied
'in-line' (i.e. preceding the individual parameter declaration.

For example:

[source,java]
----
public class Customer {
    public Order placeOrder(
            Product product
           ,@Named("Quantity")
            int quantity) {
        Order order = newTransientInstance(Order.class);
        order.modifyCustomer(this);
        order.modifyProduct(product);
        order.setQuantity(quantity);
        return order;
    }
    ...
}
