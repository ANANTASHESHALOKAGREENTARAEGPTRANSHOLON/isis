[NOTE]
====
In 1.6.0 this implementation was released as part of _org.apache.isis.core:isis-module-devutils-jdo:1.6.0_ and was also released as an http://github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-devutils[Isis addon] module. *In 1.7.0+ only the http://github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-devutils[Isis addon] implementation is released.*

The `DeveloperUtilitiesService` service provides a number of development-time utilities, mostly related to accessing/interacting with the Isis metamodel. These are visible in the UI, either as menu actions or as contributed actions. All actions are annotated with xref:_ug_reference-annotations_manpage-Action_restrictTo[`@Action#restrictTo()`] to restrict to prototype mode (suppressed from production mode).




== API

The API defined by `DeveloperUtilitiesService` (some annotations omitted) is:

[source,java]
----
public interface DeveloperUtilitiesService {

    public Clob downloadMetaModel();

    public Blob downloadLayouts();

    public void refreshServices();

    @NotInServiceMenu
    public Clob downloadLayout(Object domainObject);

    @Deprecated // as of 1.4.0
    @Hidden     // as of 1.4.0
    @NotInServiceMenu
    public Object refreshLayout(Object domainObject);
}
----

where:

* `downloadMetaModel()` allows the developer to download a CSV spreadsheet of the Isis metamodel.

The developer can then review the metadata that has Isis has captured about each domain type: for example whether a business rule (hide/disable/validate) has been implemented for each member (also indicating the implementation)

* `downloadLayouts()` allows the developer can download a ZIP file of `Xxx.layout.json` files for each domain type in the Isis metamodel.

This is useful if converting a domain model to use xref:_ug_wicket-viewer_layout_dynamic-object-layout[dynamic layouts].

* `downloadLayout()` (contributed action) allows the developer can download the `Xxx.layout.json` for an individual object

*

`refreshServices()` allows the developer to rebuild the Isis metamodel of all domain services. This is particularly useful for picking up changes to link:../../more-advanced-topics/how-to-01-062-How-to-decouple-dependencies-using-contributions.html[contributed actions]

The `refreshLayout()` (which rebuild the Isis metamodel of the current object so that the UI refreshes) has been deprecated and hidden; the xref:_ug_wicket-viewer[Wicket viewer]) (when running in prototype mode) now automatically does this does this.




== Implementations

The core framework provides a default implementation of this API:

* `org.apache.isis.core.metamodel.services.devutils.DeveloperUtilitiesServiceDefault`



== Register the Service

So long as the Maven module is on the classpath, the domain services are automatically registered.
