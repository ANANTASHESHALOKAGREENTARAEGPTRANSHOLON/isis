The REST API opens up an Isis domain model to a huge variety of applications, from bespoke single-page apps, through integration scenarious, through providing an API for bulk-upload/migration from an existing system.

== Restful Objects Specification

IMPORTANT: TODO - a brief summary here

The Restful Objects spec can be downloaded link:http://restfulobjects.org[here].

== Pretty printing

The JSON representations generated by the Restful Objects viewer are in compact form if the xref:_ug_runtime_deployment-types[deployment type] is SERVER (ie production), but will automatically be "pretty printed" (in other words indented) if the deployment type is PROTOTYPE.
