IMPORTANT: TODO

== persistence.xml file


== Eagerly Registering Entity Types


== Disabling persistence-by-reachability


== Transaction Management


== Using Neo4J (instead of an RDBMS)



== JDO/DataNucleus configuration

Any Isis properties with the prefix `isis.persistor.datanucleus.impl` are passed through directly to the JDO/DataNucleus objectstore (with the prefix stripped off, of course).

DataNucleus will itself search for additional XML mapping files, eg `mappings.jdo`.  These an be used to override any annotations of annotated entities.
