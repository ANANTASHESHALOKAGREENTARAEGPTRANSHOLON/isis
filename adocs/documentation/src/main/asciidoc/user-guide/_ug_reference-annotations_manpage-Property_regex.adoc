The `@RegEx` annotation may be applied to any string property, or to any
parameter within an action method. It can also be applied to any
string-based value type. It serves both to validate and potentially to
normalise the format of the input. `@Regex` is therefore similar in use
to `@Mask` <!--(see ?)--> but provides more flexibility.

The syntax is:

`@RegEx(validation = &quot;regEx string&quot;,
        format = &quot;regEx string&quot;, caseSensitive =
        &lt;true|false&gt;)`

Only the first parameter is required; the `format` defaults to "no
formatting", and `caseSensitive` defaults to false.

For example:

[source,java]
----
public class Customer {
    @RegEx(validation = "(\\w+\\.)*\\w+@(\\w+\\.)+[A-Za-z]+")
    public String getEmail() {}
    ...
}
----
