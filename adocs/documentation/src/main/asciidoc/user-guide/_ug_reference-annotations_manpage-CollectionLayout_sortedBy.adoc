IMPORTANT: WIP ... this section


The `@SortedBy` annotation is an instruction hint for (`SortedSet`) collections to use the specified comparator rather than the natural ordering of the entity
(as would usually be the case).

For example, this is taken from the Isis addons example https://github.com/isisaddons/isis-app-todoapp/[todoapp] (not ASF):

[source,java]
----
public class ToDoItem implements Comparable<ToDoItem> {

    ...
    public static class DependenciesComparator implements Comparator<ToDoItem> {
        @Override
        public int compare(ToDoItem p, ToDoItem q) {
            return ORDERING_BY_DESCRIPTION
                    .compound(Ordering.<ToDoItem>natural())
                    .compare(p, q);
        }
    }

    ...
    @SortedBy(DependenciesComparator.class)
    public SortedSet<ToDoItem> getDependencies() { ... }

    public int compareTo(final ToDoItem other) {
        return ORDERING_BY_COMPLETE
                .compound(ORDERING_BY_DUE_BY)
                .compound(ORDERING_BY_DESCRIPTION)
                .compare(this, other);
    }
    ...
}
----

When the `dependencies` collection is rendered, the elements are sorted by the `description` property first:

Without this annotation, the order would have been inverted (because the natural ordering places items not completed before those items that have been completed.




As an alternative to using the annotation, the dynamic xref:_ug_wicket-viewer_layout_dynamic-object-layout[`.layout.json`]
can be used instead, eg:
