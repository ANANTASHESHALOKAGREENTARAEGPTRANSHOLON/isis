NOTE: TODO

## A MetaModel with Explicit and Inferred Semantics

* use of annotations
** reuse JEE annotations where possible
* layout hints are overridable, to avoid restarting the app/speed up feedback


## Domain Objects and Domain Services

* domain model
** domain objects
*** domain entity
*** view model
** domain service
** value type

Anything else can be (should be) ignored by annotating with `@Programmatic`.
