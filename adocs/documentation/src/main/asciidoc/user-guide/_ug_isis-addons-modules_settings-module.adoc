The http://github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-settings[Isis addons' settings] module provides a simple way to store both global (application-level) settings as well as per-user settings.

The settings service is documented here for your convenience; the full README can be found on the http://github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-settings[github site].


== Application Settings

=== API

IMPORTANT: TODO

=== Implementation

In the case of `ApplicationSettingsService`, the service is implemented by `ApplicationSettingsServiceJdo`, with the `ApplicationSetting` interface implemented by a `ApplicationSettingsJdo` entity.

The service also provides the ability to create list all existing settings, create new settings (of whichever datatype), update settings, and to delete settings.

These actions can be hidden using security if need be.

== User Settings

=== API

IMPORTANT: TODO

=== Implementation

In the case of `UserSettingsService`, the service is implemented by `UserSettingsServiceJdo`, with the `UserSetting` interface implemented by a `UserSettingsJdo` entity.

As for application settings, the user settings service also provides the ability to create list all existing settings, create new settings (of whichever datatype), update settings, and to delete settings.

These actions can be hidden using security if need be.


== Registration and Configuration

The `ApplicationSettingsServiceJdo` class and `UserSettingsServiceJdo` are annotated with `@DomainService` and so are automatically registered with the framework, with actions appearing on the secondary menu bar.

IMPORTANT: TODO - screenshot of settings menu

All actions from the services emit domain events.  If you wish to hide/disable these default actions in your application, we recommend using up a subscriber on the actions' domain events to veto their visibility/usability.






[NOTE]
====
In 1.6.0 this implementation was released as part of _org.apache.isis.core:isis-module-settings-jdo:1.6.0_ and was also released as an http://github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-settings[Isis addon] module. *In 1.7.0+ only the http://github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-settings[Isis addon] implementation is released.*

The `ApplicationSettingsService` and the `UserSettingsService` are two similar services that provide the ability to store either configuration settings. With `ApplicationSettingsService` these settings have global scope; for the `UserSettingsService` the settings are stored per user.



== ApplicationSettingsService

The API defined by `ApplicationSettingsService` is:

[source,java]
----
public interface ApplicationSettingsService {
    ApplicationSetting find(@Named("Key") String key);
}
----

where `ApplicationSetting` in turn is defined as:

[source,java]
----
public interface ApplicationSetting {

    String getKey();

    SettingType getType();
    String getDescription();

    String getValueRaw();

    String valueAsString();
    LocalDate valueAsLocalDate();
    Integer valueAsInt();
    Long valueAsLong();
    Boolean valueAsBoolean();
}
----

The intention is for implementations to store only the value of each setting as a raw string (`getValueRaw()`), however for callers the API has typesafe methods `valueAsXxx()`; calling the wrong method will throw an exception. The `getType()` property indicates the datatype of each setting.

== UserSettingsService

The API defined by `UserSettingsService` is:

[source,java]
----
public interface UserSettingsService {
    UserSetting find(@Named("User") String user, @Named("Key") String key);
}
----

where `UserSetting` in turn is defined as:

[source,java]
----
public interface ApplicationSetting {

    String getUser();
    String getKey();

    SettingType getType();
    String getDescription();

    String getValueRaw();

    String valueAsString();
    LocalDate valueAsLocalDate();
    Integer valueAsInt();
    Long valueAsLong();
    Boolean valueAsBoolean();
}
----

This is typesafe following the same pattern as `ApplicationSetting`, discussed above.
