Title: Writing a Custom Theme (1.8.0)

The Isis Wicket viewer uses http://getbootstrap.com/[Bootstrap] styles and components (courtesy of the
https://github.com/l0rdn1kk0n/wicket-bootstrap[Wicket Bootstrap] integration).

By default the viewer uses the default bootstrap theme. As described link:showing-a-theme-chooser.html[here], it is
possible to allow the user to select other themes provided by http://bootswatch.com[bootswatch.com], and if required
one of these can be link:specifying-a-default-theme.html[set as the default].

However, you may instead want to write your own custom theme, for example to fit your company's look-n-feel/interface
guidelines. This is done by implementing https://github.com/l0rdn1kk0n/wicket-bootstrap[Wicket Bootstrap]â€™s
`de.agilecoders.wicket.core.settings.ITheme` class. This defines: 

* the name of the theme
* the resources it needs (the CSS and optional JS and/or fonts), and
* optional urls to load them from a Content Delivery Network (CDN).

To make use of the custom `ITheme` the application should register it by adding the following snippet in
(your application's subclass of) `IsisWicketApplication`:

public void init() {

    ...
    IBootstrapSettings settings = new BootstrapSettings();
    ThemeProvider themeProvider = new SingleThemeProvider(new MyTheme());
    settings.setThemeProvider(themeProvider);

    Bootstrap.install(getClass(), settings);
}
