Title: Rendering of abstract properties in tables

For more info, see https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ISIS-582[ISIS-582].

Suppose you have a hierarchy of classes where a property is derived and abstract in the superclass, concrete implementations in the subclasses. For example:

[source]
----
public abstract class LeaseTerm {
    ...
    public abstract BigDecimal getEffectiveValue(); 
    ...
}

public class LeaseTermForIndexableTerm extends LeaseTerm {
    ...
    public BigDecimal getEffectveValue() { ... }
    ...
}
----

Currently the Wicket viewer will not render the property in tables (though the property is correctly rendered in views):

The work-around is simple enough; make the method concrete in the superclass and return a dummy implementation, eg:

[source]
----
public abstract class LeaseTerm {
    ...
    public BigDecimal getEffectiveValue() {
        // workaround for ISIS-582
        return null;
    }
    ...
}
----

Alternatively the implementation could throw a `RuntimeException`, eg 

[source]
----
throw new RuntimeException("never called; workaround for ISIS-582");
----
