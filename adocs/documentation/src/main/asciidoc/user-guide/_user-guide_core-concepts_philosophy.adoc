This section describes some of the core ideas and architectural patterns upon which Apache Isis builds.

== Domain-Driven Design

There's no doubt that we developers love the challenge of understanding
and deploying complex technologies. But understanding the nuances and
subtleties of the business domain itself is just as great a challenge,
perhaps more so. If we devoted our efforts to understanding and addressing
those subtleties, we could build better, cleaner, and more maintainable
software that did a better job for our stakeholders. And there's no doubt
that our stakeholders would thank us for it.

A couple of years back Eric Evans wrote his book link:http://www.amazon.co.uk/Domain-driven-Design-Tackling-Complexity-Software/dp/0321125215[Domain-Driven Design], which is well on its way to
becoming a seminal work. In fact, most if not all of the ideas in Evans'
book have been expressed before, but what he did was pull those ideas
together to show how predominantly object-oriented techniques can be used
to develop rich, deep, insightful, and ultimately useful business
applications.

There are two central ideas at the heart of domain-driven design.

* the *_ubiquitous language_* is about getting the whole team (both domain experts
  and developers) to communicate more transparently using a domain model.

* Meanwhile, *_model-driven design_* is about capturing that model in a
  very straightforward manner in code.

Let's look at each in turn.

=== Ubiquitous Language

It's no secret that the IT industry is plagued by project failures. Too
often systems take longer than intended to implement, and when finally
implemented, they don't address the real requirements anyway.

Over the years we in IT have tried various approaches to address this
failing. Using waterfall methodologies, we've asked for requirements to
be fully and precisely written down before starting on anything
else. Or, using
agile methodologies, we've realized that requirements are likely to
change anyway and have sought to deliver systems incrementally using
feedback loops to refine the implementation.

But let's not get distracted talking about methodologies. At the end
of the day what really matters is communication between the domain
experts (that is, the business) who need the system and the techies
actually implementing it. If the two don't have and cannot evolve a
shared understanding of what is required, then the chance of delivering
a useful system will be next to nothing.

Bridging this gap is traditionally what business analysts are for;
they act as interpreters between the domain experts and the developers.
However, this still means there are two (or more) languages in use,
making it difficult to verify that the system being built is correct. If
the analyst mistranslates a requirement, then neither the domain expert
nor the application developer will discover this until (at best) the
application is first demonstrated or (much worse) an end user sounds
the alarm once the application has been deployed into production.

Rather than trying to translate between a business language and a
technical language, with  _DDD_ we aim to have the
business and developers using the same terms for the same concepts in order to
create a single *_domain model_*. This domain model
identifies the relevant concepts of the domain, how they relate, and
ultimately where the responsibilities are. This single domain model
provides the vocabulary for the  ubiquitous language for our
system.

.Ubiquitous Language
****
Build a common language between the domain experts and developers
by using the concepts of the domain model as the primary means of
communication. Use the terms in speech, in diagrams, in writing, and when
presenting.

If an idea cannot be expressed using this set of concepts, then go
back and extend the model. Look for and remove ambiguities and
inconsistencies.
****



Creating a  ubiquitous language calls upon everyone involved in the system's development
to express what they are doing through the vocabulary provided by the
model. If this can't be done, then our model is incomplete. Finding the
missing words deepens our understanding of the domain being modeled.

This might sound like nothing more than me insisting that the
developers shouldn't use jargon when talking to the business. Well,
that's true enough, but it's not a one-way street. A  *ubiquitous
language* demands that the developers work hard to understand the
problem domain, but it also demands that the business works hard in
being  *precise* in its naming and descriptions of those
concepts. After all, ultimately the developers will have to express
those concepts in a computer programming language.

Also, although here I'm talking about the "domain experts" as being a
homogeneous group of people, often they may come from different branches
of the business. Even if we weren't building a computer system, there's a
lot of value in helping the domain experts standardize their own
terminology. Is the marketing department's "prospect" the same as sales'
"customer," and is that the same as an after-sales "contract"?

The need for precision within the  ubiquitous language
also helps us scope the system. Most business processes evolve piecemeal
and are often quite ill-defined. If the domain experts have a very good
idea of what the business process should be, then that's a good
candidate for automation, that is, including it in the scope of the
system. But if the domain experts find it hard to agree, then it's
probably best to leave it out. After all, human beings are rather more
capable of dealing with fuzzy situations than computers.

So, if the development team (business and developers together)
continually searches to build their  ubiquitous language,
then the domain model naturally becomes richer as the nuances of the
domain are uncovered. At the same time, the knowledge of the business
domain experts also deepens as edge conditions and contradictions that
have previously been overlooked are explored.

We use the  ubiquitous language to build up a domain
model. But what do we do  *with* that model? The answer to
that is the second of our central ideas.


=== Model-Driven Design

Of the various methodologies that the IT industry has tried, many
advocate the production of separate analysis models and implementation
models. One example (from the mid 2000s) was that of the  _OMG_'s Model-Driven Architecture ( _MDA_) initiative, with its
platform-independent model (the  _PIM_) and a
platform-specific model (the  _PSM_).

Bah and humbug! If we use our  ubiquitous language just
to build up a high-level analysis model, then we will re-create the
communication divide. The domain experts and business analysts will look
only to the analysis model, and the developers will look only to the
implementation model. Unless the mapping between the two is completely
mechanical, inevitably the two will diverge.

What do we mean by  *model* anyway? For some, the term will bring to
mind  _UML_ class or sequence diagrams and the like. But
this isn't a model; it's a visual  *representation* of some
aspect of a model. No, a domain model is a group of related concepts,
identifying them, naming them, and defining how they relate. What is in
the model depends on what our objective is. We're not looking to simply
model everything that's out there in the real world. Instead, we want to
take a relevant abstraction or simplification of it and then make it do
something useful for us. Oft quoted and still true is that a model is neither
right nor wrong, just more or less useful.

For our  ubiquitous language to have value, the domain
model that encodes it must have a straightforward, literal
representation to the design of the software, specifically to the implementation. Our
software's design should be driven by this model; we should have a
model-driven design.


.Model-Driven Design
****
There must be a straightforward and very literal way to represent
the domain model in terms of software. The model should balance these
two requirements: form the  ubiquitous language of the
development team and be representable in code.

Changing the code means changing the model; refining the model
requires a change to the code.
****


Here also the word  *design* might mislead; some might again be
thinking of design documents and design diagrams. But by  *design* we mean
a way of organizing the domain concepts, which in turn leads to the way
in which we organize their representation in code.

Luckily, using *_object-oriented_*
( _OO_) languages such as Java, this is relatively easy
to do;  _OO_ is based on a modeling paradigm anyway. We
can express domain concepts using classes and interfaces, and we can
express the relationships between those concepts using associations.


So far so good. Or maybe, so far so much motherhood and apple pie.
Understanding the  _DDD_ concepts isn't the same as being
able to apply them, and some of the  _DDD_ ideas can be
difficult to put into practice. What this book is about is how Naked
Objects eases that path by applying these central ideas of
_DDD_ in a very concrete way. So, now would be a good time
to see how.




== Naked Objects Pattern

Apache Isis implements the naked objects pattern, originally formulated by Richard Pawson.  So who better than Richard to explain the origination of the idea?

pass:[<div class="extended-quote-first"><p>]The Naked Objects pattern arose, at least in part, from my own
frustration at the lack of success of the domain-driven approach. Good examples were hard to find--as they are still.
pass:[</p></div>]

pass:[<div class="extended-quote"><p>]A common complaint from _DDD_ practitioners was that it
was hard to gain enough commitment from business stakeholders, or even to engage them at all. My own experience
suggested that it was nearly impossible to engage business managers with _UML_ diagrams.  It was much easier to
engage them in rapid prototyping -- where they could see and interact with the results -- but most forms of rapid
prototyping concentrate on the presentation layer, often at the expense of the underlying model and certainly
at the expense of abstract thinking.
pass:[</p></div>]

pass:[<div class="extended-quote"><p>]Even if you could engage the business sponsors sufficiently to design a
domain model, by the time you'd finished developing the system on top of the domain model, most of its benefits
had disappeared. It's all very well creating an agile domain object model, but if any change to that model
also dictates the modification of one or more layers underneath it (dealing with persistence) and multiple layers
on top (dealing with presentation), then that agility is practically worthless.
pass:[</p></div>]

pass:[<div class="extended-quote"><p>]The other concern that gave rise to the birth of Naked Objects was how to
make user interfaces of mainstream business systems more "expressive" -- how to make them feel more like using
a drawing program or _CAD_ system. Most business systems are not at all expressive; they treat the user merely
as a dumb *process-follower*, rather than as an empowered *problem-solver*.  Even the so-called usability experts
had little to say on the subject: try finding the word "empowerment" or any synonym thereof in the index of any
book on usability. Research had demonstrated that the best way to achieve expressiveness was to create an object-oriented
user interface (_OOUI_). In practice, though, __OOUI__s were notoriously hard to develop.
pass:[</p></div>]

pass:[<div class="extended-quote"><p>]Sometime in the late 1990s, it dawned on me that if the domain model
really did represent the "ubiquitous language" of the business and those domain objects were behaviorally rich
(that is, business logic is encapsulated as methods on the domain objects rather than in procedural scripts on top
of them), then the _UI_ could be nothing more than a reflection of the user interface. This would solve
both of my concerns. It would make it easier to do domain-driven design, because one could instantly translate
evolving domain modeling ideas into a working prototype. And it would deliver an expressive, object-oriented
user interface for free. Thus was born the idea of Naked Objects.

You can learn much more about the pattern in the book, link:http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0470844205/[Naked Objects], also freely available to link:http://www.nakedobjects.org/book/[read online].  Richard co-wrote the book with one of Isis' committers, Robert Matthews, who was in turn the author of the Naked Objects Framework for Java (the original codebase of of Apache Isis).

You might also want to read Richard's link:core-concepts/Pawson-Naked-Objects-thesis.pdf[PhD on the subject].

[TIP]
====
One of the external examiners for Richard's PhD was link:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trygve_Reenskaug[Trygve Reenskaug], who originally formulated the MVC pattern at Xeroc PARC.  In his paper, link:http://heim.ifi.uio.no/~trygver/2007/2007.02.13-babyUML.pdf[Baby UML], Reenskaug describes that when implemented the first MVC, "the conventional wisdom in the group was that objects should be visible and tangible, thus bridging the gap between the human brain and the abstract data within the computer."  Sound familiar?  It's interesting to speculate what might have been if this idea had been implemented back then in the late 70s.

Reenskaug then goes on to say that "this simple and powerful idea failed because ... users were used to seeing [objects] from different perspectives. The visible and tangible object would get very complex if it should be able to show itself and be manipulated in many different ways."

In Apache Isis the responsibility of rendering an object is not the object itself, it is the framework.  Rather, the object inspects the object and uses that to decide how to render the object.  This is also extensible.  In the http://isisaddons.org[Isis Addons] (non-ASF) the http://github.com/isisaddons/isis-wicket-gmap3}[Isis addons' gmap3 modue] renders any object with latitude/longitude on a map, while http://github.com/isisaddons/isis-wicket-fullcalendar2}[Isis addons' fullcalendar2 wicket extension] renders any object with date(s) on a calendar.

=== Object Interface Mapping

Another -- more technical -- way to think about the naked objects pattern is as an _object interface mapper_, or `OIM`.  We sometimes use this idea to explain naked objects to a bunch of developers.

Just as an ORM (such as link:http://datanucleus.org[DataNucleus] or link:http:hibernate.org[Hibernate]) maps domain entities to a database, you can think of the naked objects pattern as representing the concept of mapping domain objects to a user interface.

This is the way that the link:http://metawidget.org/[MetaWidget] team, in particular Richard Kennard, the primary contributor, likes to describe their tool.  MetaWidget has a number of ideas in common with Apache Isis, specifically the runtime generation of a UI for domain objects.  You can hear more from Kennard and others on this http://devchat.tv/js-jabber/150-jsj-oims[Javascript Jabber podcast].

The hexagonal architecture is also known as the link:http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?PortsAndAdaptersArchitecture:[Ports and Adapters] architecture or (less frequently) as the link:http://jeffreypalermo.com/blog/the-onion-architecture-part-1/[Onion] architecture.

== Aspect Oriented

Although not implemented using an aspect-oriented language such as AspectJ, Isis takes considerable inspiration from AOP concepts.

For example, the UI visualization automatically provided by Isis can be thought of (and is!) treating the UI as a cross-cutting concern.

Isis' also has support for traits/mixins through its <<Contributions>>.  This allows functionality from one class (a domain service) to be rendered as if it belongs to another (a domain object).
