Isis' own configuration properties are simple key-value pairs, typically held in the `WEBINF/isis.properties` file and other related files.  This chapter describes how to configure an Apache Isis application.

[NOTE]
====
Configuration properties for the viewers can be found in the <<Wicket Viewer>> chapter and the <<Restful Objects Viewer>> chapter.

[TIP]
====
The configuration values are "baked" into the WAR file.  Details on how to override these configuration properties externally for different environments can be found in the <<Deployment>> chapter.
