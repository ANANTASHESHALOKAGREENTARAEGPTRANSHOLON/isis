IMPORTANT: WIP ... this section

The `@DescribedAs` annotation is used to provide a short description of something that features on the user interface. How this description is used will depend upon the viewing mechanism - but it may be thought of as being like a 'tool tip'.

[NOTE]
====
The `describedAs()` attribute can also be specified for xref:_ug_reference-annotations_manpage-CollectionLayout_describedAs[collections],  xref:_ug_reference-annotations_manpage-PropertyLayout_describedAs[properties], xref:_ug_reference-annotations_manpage-ActionLayout_describedAs[actions], xref:_ug_reference-annotations_manpage-DomainObjectLayout_describedAs[domain objects] and xref:_ug_reference-annotations_manpage-ViewModelLayout_describedAs[view models].
====

Descriptions may be provided for objects, members (properties,
collections and actions), and for individual parameters within an action
method. `@DescribedAs` therefore works in a very similar manner to
`@Named` <!--(see ?)-->.


To provide a description for an individual action parameter, use the
`@DescribedAs` annotation in-line i.e. immediately before the parameter
declaration.

For example:

[source,java]
----
public class Customer {
    public Order placeOrder(
                      Product product,
                      @Named("Quantity")
                      @DescribedAs("The quantity of the product being ordered")
                      int quantity) {
        Order order = createTransientInstance(Order.class);
        order.modifyCustomer(this);
        order.modifyProduct(product);
        order.setQuantity(quantity);
        return order;
    }
    ...
}
