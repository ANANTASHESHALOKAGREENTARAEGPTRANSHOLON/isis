IMPORTANT: WIP ... this section


For immutable objects where there is a bounded set of instances, the
`@Bounded` annotation can be used.

For example:

[source,java]
----
@Bounded
public class County {
    ...
}
----

The number of instances is expected to be small enough that all instance can be held in memory. The viewer will use this information to render all the instances of this class in a drop-down list or equivalent.


[NOTE]
====
Although this is not enforced, `@Bounded` is intended for use on `final` classes. Its behaviour when used on interfaces, or classes with sub-classes is not specified
