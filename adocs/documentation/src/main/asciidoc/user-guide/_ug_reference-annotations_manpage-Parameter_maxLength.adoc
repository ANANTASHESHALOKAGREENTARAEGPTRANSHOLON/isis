IMPORTANT: WIP ... this section


The `@MaxLength` annotation indicates the maximum number of characters that the user may enter into a `String` property, or a `String` parameter in an action, or for a string-based value type. It is ignored if applied to any other type.

For example:

[source,java]
----
public class CustomerRepository {
    public Customer newCustomer(
        @MaxLength(30)
        @Named("First Name") String firstName
       ,@MaxLength(30)
        @Named("Last Name") String lastName) {
    ...
}
----


If the model is being persisted to a relational database then `@MaxLength` should be specified for all `String` properties and action parameters.
