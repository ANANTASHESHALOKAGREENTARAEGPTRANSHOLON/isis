Apache Isis includes an extensive number of domain services for your domain objects to use; these are listed in xref:__a_id_chapter_a_reference_domain_services_(api)[Reference: Domain Services (API)].  But some of the services interfaces defined in the applib are intended to be used (primarily) not by your domain objects but instead by Isis itself.

A good example of this is the xref:__code_auditingservice3_code[`AuditingService3`] service; if an implementation is present then Isis will call that service in order to record audit log entries.  If no implementation is available then Isis will carry on regardless.

Some domain services can be considered both API and SPI; a good example is the `EmailService` that is of direct use for domain objects wishing to send out emails, but is also used by the framework to support the user registration functionality supported by the xref:_wicket_viewer[Wicket viewer].   The same is true of the xref:__code_eventbusservice_code[`EventBusService`]; this can be used by domain objects to broadcast arbitrary events, but is also used by the framework to automatically emit events eg for `@Action(domainEvent=...)`.  For these hybrid services we have categorized the service as an "API" service.  This chapter therefore contains only the strictly SPI services.
