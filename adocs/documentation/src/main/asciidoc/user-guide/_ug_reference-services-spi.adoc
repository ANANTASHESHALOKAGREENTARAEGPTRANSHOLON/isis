Apache Isis includes an extensive number of domain services for your domain objects to use; these are listed in xref:_ug_reference-services-api[Reference: Domain Services (API)] chapter.

There are other domain services that constitute not an API but an SPI; if present they are used by Isis itself rather than by your domain objects.  A good example of this is the xref:_ug_reference-services-spi_manpage-AuditingService[`AuditingService`] service; if an implementation is present then Isis will call that service in order to record audit log entries.  If no implementation is available then Isis will carry on regardless.

Some domain services can be considered both API and SPI; a good example is the xref:_ug_reference-services-api_manpage-EmailService[`EmailService`] that is of direct use for domain objects wishing to send out emails, but is also used by the framework to support the xref:_ug_wicket-viewer_features_user-registration[user registration] functionality supported by the xref:_ug_wicket-viewer[Wicket viewer].   The same is true of the xref:_ug_reference-services-api_manpage-EventBusService[`EventBusService`]; this can be used by domain objects to broadcast arbitrary events, but is also used by the framework to automatically emit events for xref:_ug_reference-annotations_manpage-Action_domainEvent[`@Action#domainEvent()`] etc.

For these hybrid services we have categorized the service as an "API" service.  This chapter therefore contains only the strictly SPI services.


The table below lists the SPIs that are defined in the Isis applib (`o.a.i.core:isis-core-applib` module).

Where an implementation is available (on the classpath) then it is always registered automatically (that is, they are all (with one exception) annotated with xref:_ug_reference-annotations_manpage-DomainService[`@DomainService`].  The one exception is xref:_ug_reference-services-spi_manpage-ExceptionRecognizer[`ExceptionRecognizer`], which must be registered explicitly in `isis.properties`; this makes the service extensible (for new exceptions to be recognized).




There are also some "internal" SPI services whose definitions depend on the internals of the framework (rather than the applib).
