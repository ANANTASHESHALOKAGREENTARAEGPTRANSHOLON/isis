Title: @ViewModelLayout (1.8.0)

____

stub

____

The `@ViewModelLayout` annotation is identical to the link:./DomainObjectLayout.html[@DomainObjectLayout], but is provided
for symmetry with domain objects that have been annotated using link:./ViewModel.html[@ViewModel] (rather than `@DomainObject(nature=VIEW_MODEL)`).

[source]
----
@ViewModel(...)
@ViewModelLayout(...)
public class MyViewModel { ... }
----

== Source code

See <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ISIS-970">ISIS-970</a> and <a href="https://github.com/apache/isis/blob/master/core/applib/src/main/java/org/apache/isis/applib/annotation/ViewModelLayout.java">@ViewModelLayout</a> source code.

== See also

Similar layout annotations exist for other elements of the metamodel:

* link:./ActionLayout.html[@ActionLayout] for actions
* link:./CollectionLayout.html[@CollectionLayout] for collections
* link:./PropertyLayout.html[@PropertyLayout] for properties
* link:./ParameterLayout.html[@ParameterLayout] for action parameters
* link:./DomainObjectLayout.html[@DomainObjectLayout]
* link:./DomainServiceLayout.html[@DomainServiceLayout]

Corresponding domain semantics:

* link:./ViewModel.html[@ViewModel]




== `cssClass()`

Title: @CssClass

____

Deprecated, use instead link:./DomainObjectLayout.html[@DomainObjectLayout#cssClass()], link:./PropertyLayout.html[@PropertyLayout#cssClass()], link:./CollectionLayout.html[@CollectionLayout#cssClass()], link:./ActionLayout.html[@ActionLayout#cssClass()] and link:./ParameterLayout.html[@ParameterLayout#cssClass()], or use link:../../components/viewers/wicket/dynamic-layouts.html[dynamic layouts].

____

The `CssClass` annotation applies to object and also to any object member
(property, collection or action). It is used by the Wicket viewer as a UI hint
to render specified CSS classes around the representation of the element.

Application-specific CSS can then be used to target and adjust the UI representation
of that particular element.

For example:

[source]
----
@CssClass("x-main")
public class ToDoItem { ... }
----

or

[source]
----
public class ToDoItem {

    @CssClass("x-key")
    public LocalDate getDueBy() { ... }

}
----

== Alternatives (`.layout.json`)

As an alternative to using the `@CssClass` annotation, the `.layout.json`
link:../../components/viewers/wicket/dynamic-layouts.html[dynamic layout file]
can be specified, eg:

[source]
----
{
    "span": 6,
    "memberGroups": {
        "Priority": {
            "members": {
                ...
                "dueBy": {
                    "cssClass": { "value": "x-key" }
                }
                ....
            }
        },
        ...
    }
}
----

Note that this (currently) only supports class members, not classes

== See also (1.8.0)

The similar link:./CssClassFa-deprecated.html[CssClassFa] annotation is also used as a hint
to apply CSS, but in particular to allow http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/icons/[Font Awesome icons]
to be rendered on action butotns or as the icon for classes.




== `cssClassFa()`

Title: @CssClassFa (1.8.0)

____

Deprecated, use instead link:./DomainObjectLayout.html[@DomainObjectLayout#cssClassFa()], link:./PropertyLayout.html[@PropertyLayout#cssClassFa()], link:./ActionLayout.html[@ActionLayout#cssClassFa()] and link:./ViewModelLayout.html[@ViewModelLayout#cssClassFa()], or use link:../../components/viewers/wicket/dynamic-layouts.html[dynamic layouts].

____

The `CssClassFa` annotation applies to objects and also to object actions,
and is used by the Wicket viewer as a UI hint.

For object actions, the viewer will render the specified
http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/icons/[Font Awesome icon]
on the action's button (or menu item).

For objects, it will be used as an icon. Note that this is only used if
the object does not have a `getIconName()` method.

For example:

[source]
----
@CssClassFa("fa-check-circle")
public class ToDoItem { ... }
----

or

[source]
----
public class ToDoItem {

    @CssClass("fa-step-backward")
    public ToDoItem previous() { ... }

    @CssClass("fa-step-forward")
    public ToDoItem next() { ... }

}
----

There can be multiple "fa-" classes, eg to mirror or rotate the icon. There
is no need to include the "fa" class; it will be automatically appended.

== Alternatives (`.layout.json`)

As an alternative to using the `@CssClass` annotation, the `.layout.json`
link:../../components/viewers/wicket/dynamic-layouts.html[dynamic layout file]
can be specified, eg:

[source]
----
{
    "span": 6,
    "memberGroups": {
        "Priority": {
            "members": {
                ...
                 "relativePriority": {
                    "actions": {
                        "previous": {
                            "cssClassFa": { "value": "fa-step-backward" }
                        },
                        "next": {
                            "cssClassFa": { "value": "fa-step-forward" }
                        }
                    }
                },
                ....
            }
        },
        ...
    }
}
----

Note that this (currently) only supports class members, not classes.

== See also

The similar link:./CssClass-deprecated.html[CssClass] annotation is also used as a hint
to apply CSS, but for wrapping the representation of an object or object
member so that it can be styled in an application-specific way.




== `describedAs()`

Title: @DescribedAs

____

Deprecated, use instead link:./DomainObjectLayout.html[@DomainObjectLayout#describedAs()], link:./PropertyLayout.html[@PropertyLayout#describedAs()], link:./CollectionLayout.html[@CollectionLayout#describedAs()], link:./ActionLayout.html[@ActionLayout#describedAs()] and link:./ParameterLayout.html[@ParameterLayout#describedAs()], or use link:../../components/viewers/wicket/dynamic-layouts.html[dynamic layouts].

____

The `@DescribedAs` annotation is used to provide a short description of
something that features on the user interface. How this description is
used will depend upon the viewing mechanism - but it may be thought of
as being like a 'tool tip'.

Descriptions may be provided for objects, members (properties,
collections and actions), and for individual parameters within an action
method. `@DescribedAs` therefore works in a very similar manner to
`@Named` <!--(see ?)-->.

=== Providing a description for an object

To provide a description for an object, use the `@DescribedAs`
annotation immediately before the declaration of that object class.

For example:

[source]
----
@DescribedAs("A customer who may have originally become known to us via " +
             "the marketing system or who may have contacted us directly.")
public class ProspectiveSale {
   ...
}
----

=== Providing a description for an object member

Any member (property, collection or action) may provide a description.
To specify this description, use the `@DescribedAs` annotation
immediately before the declaration of that member.

For example:

[source]
----
public class Customer {
    @DescribedAs("The name that the customer has indicated that they wish to be " +
                 "addressed as (e.g. Johnny rather than Jonathan)")
    public String getFirstName() { ... }
}
----

=== Providing a description for an action parameter

To provide a description for an individual action parameter, use the
`@DescribedAs` annotation in-line i.e. immediately before the parameter
declaration.

For example:

[source]
----
public class Customer {
    public Order placeOrder(
                      Product product,
                      @Named("Quantity")
                      @DescribedAs("The quantity of the product being ordered")
                      int quantity) {
        Order order = createTransientInstance(Order.class);
        order.modifyCustomer(this);
        order.modifyProduct(product);
        order.setQuantity(quantity);
        return order;
    }
    ...
}
----













== `named()`

Title: @Named

____

Deprecated, use instead link:./DomainObjectLayout.html[@DomainObjectLayout#named()], link:./PropertyLayout.html[@PropertyLayout#named()], link:./CollectionLayout.html[@CollectionLayout#named()], link:./ActionLayout.html[@ActionLayout#named()] and link:./ParameterLayout.html[@ParameterLayout#named()], or use link:../../components/viewers/wicket/dynamic-layouts.html[dynamic layouts].

____

The `@Named` annotation is used when you want to specify the way
something is named on the user interface i.e. when you do not want to
use the name generated automatically by the system. It can be applied to
objects, members (properties, collections, and actions) and to
parameters within an action method.

____

*Warning*

Generally speaking it is better to rename the property, collection or
action. The only common case where `@Named` is common is to rename
parameters for built-in value types. Even here though a custom value
type can be defined using `@Value` so that the value type is used as the
parameter name. `@Named` may also be used if the name needs punctuation
or other symbols in the name presented to the user.

____

=== Specifying the name of an object

By default the name of an object is derived, reflectively from the class
name. To specify a different name for an object, use the `@Named`
annotation in front of the class declaration.

For example:

[source]
----
@Named("Customer")
public class CustomerImpl implements Customer{
   ...
}
----

See also the `@Plural` annotation <!--, ?-->.

=== Specifying the name of a class member

By default, the name of a class member (a property, collection or
action) presented to the user is derived, reflectively, from the name of
the member defined in the program code. To specify a different name use
the `@Named
`annotation immediately before the member declaration.

For example:

[source]
----
public class Customer {

    public String getFirstName() { ... }

    public String getSurname() { ... }

    public CreditRating getCreditRating() { ... }
}
----

Note that the framework provides a separate and more powerful mechanism
for internationalisation.

=== Specifying the name for an action parameter

The most common usage of `@Named` is be to specify names for the
parameters of an action. This is because the parameter name declared in
the code for the action method cannot be picked up reflectively (by
default, the user interface will use the type of the parameter as the
name; for a `String` or a `Boolean`, this is almost certainly not what is
required).

To specify the name of a parameter, the `@Named` annotation is applied
'in-line' (i.e. preceding the individual parameter declaration.

For example:

[source]
----
public class Customer {
    public Order placeOrder(
            Product product
           ,@Named("Quantity")
            int quantity) {
        Order order = newTransientInstance(Order.class);
        order.modifyCustomer(this);
        order.modifyProduct(product);
        order.setQuantity(quantity);
        return order;
    }
    ...
}
----

An alternative is to use a value type (though this introduces additional mapping complexity for both viewers and objectstore) <!--, as described in ?-->.












== `paged()`

Title: @Paged

____

Deprecated, use instead link:./CollectionLayout.html[@CollectionLayout] and link:./DomainObjectLayout.html[@DomainObjectLayout].

____

This annotation is used to indicate that parented and/or standalone
collections should be paginated.

When annotated on a collection, `@Paged` indicates the page size of a
parented collection. When annotated on a type, `@Paged` indicates the page
size of a standalone collection.

For example:

[source]
----
@Paged(30)
public class Order {

    @Paged(15)
    public List<LineItem> getDetails() {...}
}
----

This indicates a page size of 15 for parented collections, and a page
size of 30 for standalone collections.

When omitting a parameter value or omitting the annotation completely,
the configured defaults in `isis.properties` will be used.

For example:

[source]
----
isis.viewers.paged.standalone=20
isis.viewers.paged.parented=5
----

This indicates a page size of 5 for parented collections and a page size
of 20 for standalone collections.





== `plural()`

Title: @Plural

____

Deprecated, use instead link:./DomainObjectLayout.html[@DomainObjectLayout#plural()].

____

When the framework displays a collection of several objects it may use
the plural form of the object type in the title. By default the plural
name will be created by adding an 's' to the end of the singular name
(whether that is the class name or another name specified using
`@Named`). Where the single name ends in 'y' then the default plural
name will end in 'ies' - for example a collection of `Country` objects
will be titled 'Countries'. Where these conventions do not work, the
programmer may specify the plural form of the name using `@Plural`.

For example:

[source]
----
@Plural("Children")
public class Child {
    // members and actions here
}
----
