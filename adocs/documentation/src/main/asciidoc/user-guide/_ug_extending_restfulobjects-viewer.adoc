The Restful Objects viewer implements the http://restfulobjects.org[Restful Object spec], meaning that it:

* defines a well-defined set of endpoint URLs as resources
* generates a well-defined set of (JSON) representations when these resources are accessed.

There are, however, a number of other "standards" for defining representations, among these:

* http://stateless.co/hal_specification.html[HAL] (Mike Kelly)
* http://amundsen.com/media-types/collection/[Collection+JSON] (Mike Amundsen)
* https://github.com/kevinswiber/siren[Siren] (Kevin Swiber)
* http://jsonapi.org/[JSON API] (Steve Klabnik)
* https://github.com/cainus/hyper-json-spec[Hyper+JSON] (Gregg Cainus)
* https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld/[JSON-LD] (W3C)
* http://www.markus-lanthaler.com/hydra/[Hydra] (Markus Lanthaler)

A good discussion about the relative merits of several of these different hypermedia formats can be found https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/api-craft/NgjzQYVOE4s/EAB2jxtU_TMJ[here].

While Isis' Restful Objects viewer only has "out-of-the-box" support for the representations defined in the Restful Objects spec,
it is possible to plugin a custom representation generator that can produce any arbitrary representation.

[TIP]
====
If all that is required is a very simple representations (of objects), you can instead reconfigure RO viewer to provide a simplified output, as described xref:_simplified_object_representation[here].  Or, it is also possible to simply suppress certain elements, as described  xref:_suppressing_elements_of_the_representations[here].

== API

The API to implement is the `RepresentationService` API:

[WARNING]
====
This API should be considered beta, as it may change in the future in response to emerging requirements
====

[source,java]
----
import javax.ws.rs.core.Response;
import org.apache.isis.applib.annotation.Programmatic;
import org.apache.isis.core.metamodel.adapter.ObjectAdapter;
import org.apache.isis.viewer.restfulobjects.rendering.RendererContext;
import org.apache.isis.viewer.restfulobjects.rendering.domainobjects.*;

public interface RepresentationService {

    @Programmatic
    Response objectRepresentation(
            Context rendererContext,
            ObjectAdapter objectAdapter);

    @Programmatic
    Response propertyDetails(
            Context rendererContext,
            ObjectAndProperty objectAndProperty,
            MemberReprMode memberReprMode);

    @Programmatic
    Response collectionDetails(
            Context rendererContext,
            ObjectAndCollection objectAndCollection,
            MemberReprMode memberReprMode);

    @Programmatic
    Response actionPrompt(
            Context rendererContext,
            ObjectAndAction objectAndAction);

    @Programmatic
    Response actionResult(
            Context rendererContext,
            ObjectAndActionInvocation objectAndActionInvocation,
            ActionResultReprRenderer.SelfLink selfLink);

    public static interface Context extends RendererContext {
        ObjectAdapterLinkTo getAdapterLinkTo();
    }
}

== Default Implementation

Restful Objects' out-of-the-box support for Restful Objects spec uses this same API, specifically `RepresentationServiceForRestfulObjects` (in the `org.apache.isis.viewer.restfulobjects.rendering.service` package).

Each of these methods provides:

* a `RendererContext` +
+
providing access to request-specific context (eg HTTP headers), session-specific context (eg authentication) and global context (eg configuration settings)

* an object representing the information to be rendered +
+
eg `ObjectAdapter`, `ObjectAndProperty`, `ObjectAndCollection` etc

* for members, whether the representation is in read/write mode +
+
ie `MemberReprMode`


== Configuring your Implementation

Implement the service and register in `WEB-INF/isis.properties`, eg:

[source,ini]
----
isis.services=...,\
              com.mycompany.myservice.RepresentationServiceForMyRestApi,
              ...
----

This will replace the default implementatoin.
