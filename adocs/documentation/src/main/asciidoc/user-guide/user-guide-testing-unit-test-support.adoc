Isis Core provides a number of unit test helpers for you to use (if you wish) to test your domain objects.  To use, update the `pom.xml`:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.isis.core</groupId>
    <artifactId>isis-core-unittestsupport</artifactId>
    <scope>test</scope> // <1>
</dependency>
----
<1> Normally `test`; usual Maven scoping rules apply.



== ``SortedSet``s Contract Test

This contract test automatically checks that all fields of type `java.util.Collection` are declared as `java.util.SortedSet`. In other words, it precludes either `java.util.List` or `java.util.Set` from being used as a collection.

For example, the following passes the contract test:

[source,java]
----
public class Department {
    private SortedSet<Employee> employees = new TreeSet<Employee>();
    ...
}
----

whereas this would not:

[source,java]
----
public class SomeDomainObject {
    private List<Employee> employees = new ArrayList<Employee>();
    ...
}
----

If using the JDO/DataNucleus Objectstore then we strongly recommend that you implement this test, for several reasons:

* First, ``Set``s align more closely to the relational model than do `List`s. A `List` must have an additional index to specify order.

* Second, `SortedSet` is preferable to `Set` because then the order is well-defined and predictable (to an end user, to the programmer).

The <<ObjectContracts>> utility class substantially simplifies the task of implementing `Comparable` in your domain classes.

* Third, if the relationship is bidirectional then JDO/Objectstore will automatically maintain the relationship. See link:../components/objectstores/jdo/managed-1-to-m-relationships.html[here] for further discussion.

To use the contract test, subclass `SortedSetsContractTestAbstract`, specifying the root package to search for domain classes.

For example:

[source,java]
----
public class SortedSetsContractTestAll extends SortedSetsContractTestAbstract {

    public SortedSetsContractTestAll() {
        super("org.estatio.dom");
        withLoggingTo(System.out);
    }
}
----




== Injected Services Method Contract Test

It is quite common for some basic services to be injected in a project-specific domain object superclass; for example a `ClockService` might generally be injected everywhere:

[source,java]
----
public abstract class EstatioDomainObject {
    protected ClockService clockService;
    public void injectClockService(ClockService clockService) {
        this.clockService = clockService;
    }
}
----

If a subclass inadvertantly overrides this method and provides its own `ClockService` field, then the field in the superclass will never initialized. As you might imagine, ``NullPointerException``s could then arise.

This contract test automatically checks that the `injectXxx(...)` method, to allow for injected services, is not overridable, ie `final`.

To use the contract test, , subclass `SortedSetsContractTestAbstract`, specifying the root package to search for domain classes.

For example:

[source,java]
----
public class InjectServiceMethodMustBeFinalContractTestAll extends InjectServiceMethodMustBeFinalContractTestAbstract {

    public InjectServiceMethodMustBeFinalContractTestAll() {
        super("org.estatio.dom");
        withLoggingTo(System.out);
    }
}
----




== Bidirectional Contract Test

This contract test automatically checks that bidirectional 1:m or 1:1 associations are being maintained correctly (assuming that they follow the link:../more-advanced-topics/how-to-04-060-How-to-set-up-and-maintain-bidirectional-relationships.html[mutual registration pattern]

TIP: If using the link:../components/objectstores/jdo/about.html[JDO Object Store], then there is generally no need to programmatically maintain 1:m relationships (indeed it may introduce subtle errors). For more details, see link:../components/objectstores/jdo/managed-1-to-m-relationships.html[here]. Check out the link:../intro/resources/editor-templates.html[Eclipse templates] for further guidance.

For example, suppose that `ParentDomainObject` and `ChildDomainObject` have a 1:m relationship (`ParentDomainObject#children` / `ChildDomainObject#parent`), and also `PeerDomainObject` has a 1:1 relationship with itself (`PeerDomainObject#next` / `PeerDomainObject#previous`).

The following will exercise these relationships:

[source,java]
----
public class BidirectionalRelationshipContractTestAll
        extends BidirectionalRelationshipContractTestAbstract {

    public BidirectionalRelationshipContractTestAll() {
        super("org.apache.isis.core.unittestsupport.bidir",
                ImmutableMap.<Class<?>,Instantiator>of(
                    ChildDomainObject.class, new InstantiatorForChildDomainObject(),
                    PeerDomainObject.class, new InstantiatorSimple(PeerDomainObjectForTesting.class)
                ));
        withLoggingTo(System.out);
    }
}
----

The first argument to the constructor scopes the search for domain objects; usually this would be something like `&quot;com.mycompany.dom&quot;`.

The second argument provides a map of `Instantiator` for certain of the domain object types. This has two main purposes. First, for abstract classes, it nominates an alternative concrete class to be instantiated. Second, for classes (such as `ChildDomainObject`) that are `Comparable` and are held in a `SortedSet`), it provides the ability to ensure that different instances are unique when compared against each other. If no `Instantiator` is provided, then the contract test simply attempts to instantiates the class.

If any of the supporting methods (`addToXxx()`, `removeFromXxx()`, `modifyXxx()` or `clearXxx()`) are missing, the relationship is skipped.

To see what's going on (and to identify any skipped relationships), use the `withLoggingTo()` method call. If any assertion fails then the error should be descriptive enough to figure out the problem (without enabling logging).

The example tests can be found https://github.com/apache/isis/tree/master/core/unittestsupport/src/test/java/org/apache/isis/core/unittestsupport/bidir[here].




== JMock Extensions

`JUnitRuleMockery2` is an extension to the JMock's `JunitRuleMockery`, providing a simpler API and also providing support for autowiring.

For example, here we see that the class under test, an instance of `CollaboratingUsingSetterInjection`, is automatically wired up with its `Collaborator`:

[source,java]
----
public class JUnitRuleMockery2Test_autoWiring_setterInjection_happyCase {

    @Rule
    public JUnitRuleMockery2 context = JUnitRuleMockery2.createFor(Mode.INTERFACES_AND_CLASSES);

    @Mock
    private Collaborator collaborator;

    @ClassUnderTest
    private CollaboratingUsingSetterInjection collaborating;

    @Test
    public void wiring() {
        assertThat(collaborating.collaborator, is(not(nullValue())));
    }
}
----

The example tests can be found https://github.com/apache/isis/tree/master/core/unittestsupport/src/test/java/org/apache/isis/core/unittestsupport/jmocking[here]




== Value Objects Contract Test

The `ValueTypeContractTestAbstract` automatically tests that a custom value type implements `equals()` and `hashCode()` correctly.

For example, testing JDK's own `java.math.BigInteger` can be done as follows:

[source,java]
----
public class ValueTypeContractTestAbstract_BigIntegerTest extends ValueTypeContractTestAbstract<BigInteger> {

    @Override
    protected List<BigInteger> getObjectsWithSameValue() {
        return Arrays.asList(new BigInteger("1"), new BigInteger("1"));
    }

    @Override
    protected List<BigInteger> getObjectsWithDifferentValue() {
        return Arrays.asList(new BigInteger("2"));
    }
}
----
