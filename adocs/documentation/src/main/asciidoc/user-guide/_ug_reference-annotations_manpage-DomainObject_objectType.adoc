IMPORTANT: WIP ... this section

The `@ObjectType` annotation is used to provide a unique abbreviation for the object's class name. This is used internally to generate a string representation of an objects identity (the `Oid`).

For example:

[source,java]
----
@ObjectType("ORD")
public class Order {

    ...
}
----

If no `@ObjectType` annotation is present, then the framework uses the
fully-qualified class name.

If an `@ObjectType` is not unique, then the framework will fail to boot.
