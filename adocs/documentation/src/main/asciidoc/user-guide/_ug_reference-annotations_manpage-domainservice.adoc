The `@DomainService` annotation indicates that the (concrete) class should be automatically instantiated as a domain service.

Domain services with this annotation do NOT need to be registered explicitly in `isis.properties`; they will be
discovered automatically on the CLASSPATH.

The table below summarizes the annotation's attributes.

The `@NotContributed` annotation applies only to action methods, and
specifically to the actions of services. If present, it indicates that
the action should not be contributed to any of its domain object
arguments.

For example:

[source,java]
----
public class OrderServices {
    @NotContributed
    public void cancel(Order order);
    ...
}
----

If the action should neither be contributed nor appear in the service's
service menu, then you could instead simply mark it as `@Hidden`.

=== Contributing of one-arg actions

Actions that accept a single argument will, by default, also be contributed as an association:

* if the action returns a single object (value or entity) then the action will be contributed as a property

* if the action returns a list then the action will be contributed as a collection

This behaviour can be influenced by specifying the "As." attribute:

* use `@NotContributed(As.ACTION)` to contribute the action as an association
* use `@NotContributed(As.ASSOCIATION)` to contribute the action as an action
* use `@NotContributed` to not contribute the action at all.





The `@NotInServiceMenu` annotation applies only to action methods, and specifically to the actions of services. If present, it indicates that the action should not appear in the service menu for the service. It may, however, still be contributed to any of its domain object arguments.


For example:

[source,java]
----
public class OrderServices {
    @NotInServiceMenu
    public void cancel(Order order);
    ...
}
----



If the action should neither be contributed (see ?) nor appear in the
service's service menu, then you could instead simply mark it as `@Hidden`
<!--(see ?)-->.
