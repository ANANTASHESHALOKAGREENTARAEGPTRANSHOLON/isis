Apache Isis includes an extensive number of domain services for your domain objects to use; simply define the service as an annotated field and Isis will inject the service into your object.  These services' API are all defined in Isis' applib (`o.a.i.core:isis-core-applib` module); this minimizes the coupling between your code and Isis.  It also allows you to easily mock out these services in your unit tests.
