== anchor:reference-annotations_manpage-Collection[]`domainEvent()`

IMPORTANT: WIP ... this section

[WARNING]
====
The Wicket viewer does NOT support collection modification; instead write a pair of actions to add to/remove from the collection.

However, it _is_ possible to fire collection interaction events using the wrapper factory; see below for more details.
====


The `@CollectionInteraction` annotation applies to domain entity collections, allowing subscribers to optionally veto, validate or otherwise perform tasks before or after the collection has been added to/removed from.

Subscribers subscribe through the xref:__a_id_reference_services_api_manpage_a_code_eventbusservice_code[`EventBusService`] using Guava annotations.

By default the event raised is `CollectionInteractionEvent.Default`. For example:

[source,java]
----
public class ToDoItem {
    ...
    @CollectionInteraction
    public SortedSet<ToDoItem> getDependencies() { ... }
}
----

Optionally a subclass can be declared:

[source,java]
----
public class ToDoItem {

    public static class DependenciesChangedEvent extends CollectionInteractionEvent<ToDoItem, ToDoItem> {
        private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;
        public DependenciesChangedEvent(ToDoItem source, Identifier identifier, Of of, ToDoItem value) {
            super(source, identifier, of, value);
        }
    }

}
----

The `of` field indicates if the collection is being accessed, added to or removed from.


=== Subscribers

Subscribers (which must be domain services) subscribe using the Guava API.
Subscribers can be either coarse-grained (if they subscribe to the top-level event type):

[source,java]
----
@DomainService
public class SomeSubscriber {

    @Programmatic
    @com.google.common.eventbus.Subscribe
    public void on(CollectionInteractionEvent ev) {

        ...
    }

}
----

or can be fine-grained by subscribing to specific event subtypes:

[source,java]
----
@DomainService
public class SomeSubscriber {

    @Programmatic
    @com.google.common.eventbus.Subscribe
    public void on(ToDoItem.DependenciesChangedEvent ev) {

        ...
    }

}
----

The subscriber's method is called (up to) 5 times:

* whether to veto visibility (hide)
* whether to veto usability (disable)
* whether to veto execution (validate)
* steps to perform prior to the property being modified
* steps to perform after the property has been modified.

The subscriber can distinguish these by calling `ev.getPhase()`. Thus the general form is:

[source,java]
----
    @Programmatic
    @com.google.common.eventbus.Subscribe
    public void on(CollectionInteractionEvent ev) {

    switch(ev.getPhase()) {
        case HIDE:
            ...
            break;
        case DISABLE:
            ...
            break;
        case VALIDATE:
            ...
            break;
        case EXECUTING:
            ...
            break;
        case EXECUTED:
            ...
            break;
    }
}
----

Vetoing is performed by calling the appropriate method on the event:

*

To hide:

ev.hide()

*

To disable:

ev.disable("…");

*

To invalidate:

ev.invalidate("…");

It is also possible to abort the transaction during the executing or executed
phases by throwing an exception. If the exception is a subtype of `RecoverableException`
then the exception will be rendered as a user-friendly warning (eg Growl/toast)
rather than an error.


=== Raising events programmatically.

Normally events are only raised for interactions through the UI. However, events can be raised programmatically by
wrapping the target object using the link:../services/wrapper-factory.html[Wrapper Factory] service.


[NOTE]
====
domain events can also be raised for actions and properties.

== anchor:reference-annotations_manpage-Collection[]`editing()`

IMPORTANT: WIP ... this section

[NOTE]
====
Fully supported by: Wicket viewer; other viewers do not yet support the `where` attribute.
====

The `@Disabled` annotation means that the member cannot be used in any instance of the class. When applied to the property it means that the user may not modify the value of that property (though it may still be modified programmatically). When applied to an action method, it means that the user cannot invoke that method.

For example:

[source,java]
----
public class Customer {
    @Disabled
    public void assessCreditWorthiness() { ... }

    @Disabled
    public int getInitialCreditRating(){ ... }
    public void setInitialCreditRating(int initialCreditRating) { ... }
}
----

Note that if an action is marked as `@Disabled`, it will be shown on the
user interface but cannot ever be invoked. The only possible reason we
can think to do this is during prototyping, to indicate an action that
is still to be developed. If a method is intended for programmatic use,
but not intended ever to be invoked directly by a user, then it should
be marked as `@Hidden` instead.

This annotation can also take two parameter indicating where (in the UI)
it is to be disabled, and when (in the object's lifecycle) it is to be
disabled. For example:

[source,java]
----
public class Customer {
    (when=When.UNTIL_PERSISTED)
    public void assessCreditWorthiness() { ... }
}
----

would disable the action until the object has been saved. And:

[source,java]
----
public class Customer {
    (where=Where.PARENTED_TABLES)
    public void getFirstName() { ... }
}
----

would disable the property in parented tables but not in regular object
forms (though note: this would only be used by viewers that provide
in-table editing capability).

The acceptable values for the `where` parameter are:

* `Where.ANYWHERE` +
+
The member should be disabled everywhere.

* `Where.OBJECT_FORMS` +
+
The member should be disabled when displayed within an object form.
For most viewers, this applies to property and collection members,
not actions.

* `Where.PARENTED_TABLES` +
+
The member should be disabled when displayed as a column of a table
within a parent object's collection. For most (all?) viewers, this
will have meaning only if applied to a property member.

* `Where.STANDALONE_TABLES` +
+
The member should be disabled when displayed as a column of a table
showing a standalone list of objects, for example as returned by a
repository query. For most (all?) viewers, this will have meaning
only if applied to a property member.

* `Where.ALL_TABLES` +
+
The member should be disabled when displayed as a column of a table,
either an object's * collection or a standalone list. This combines
`PARENTED_TABLES` and `STANDALONE_TABLES`

* `Where.NOWHERE` +
+
Has no meaning for the `@Disabled` annotation (though is used by the
`@Hidden` annotation which also uses the `Where` enum<!--, see ?-->).

The acceptable values for the `when` parameter are:

* `When.ALWAYS` +
+
The member should be disabled at all times.

* `When.NEVER` +
+
The member should never be disabled (unless disabled through some
other mechanism, for example an imperative disableXxx() supporting
method)..

* `When.ONCE_PERSISTED` +
+
The member should be enabled for transient objects, but disabled for
persisted objects.

* `When.UNTIL_PERSISTED` +
+
The member should be disabled for transient objects, but enabled for
persisted objects.

By default the annotated property or action is always disabled (ie
defaults to `Where.ANYWHERE`, `When.ALWAYS`).









== anchor:reference-annotations_manpage-Collection[]`hidden()`

IMPORTANT: WIP ... this section

The `@Hidden` annotation indicates that the member (property, collection or action) to which it is applied should never be visible to the user. It can also be applied to service types (it has no effect if applied to entities or values).

For example:

[source,java]
----
public class Customer {
    @Hidden
    public int getInternalId() { ... }

    @Hidden
    public void updateStatus() { ... }
    ...
}
----

Or, applied to a service:

[source,java]
----
@Hidden
public class EmailService {
    public void sendEmail(...) { ... }
    ...
}
----

This annotation can also take a parameters indicating where and when it
is to be hidden. For example:

[source,java]
----
public class Customer {
    @Hidden(when=When.ONCE_PERSISTED)
    public int getInternalId() { ... }
    ...
}
----

would show the `Id` until the object has been saved, and then would hide
it. And:

[source,java]
----
public class Customer {
    @Hidden(where=Where.ALL_TABLES)
    public int getDateOfBirth() { ... }
    ...
}
----

would suppress the `dateOfBirth` property of a Customer from all tables.

The acceptable values for the `where` parameter are:

* `Where.ANYWHERE` +
+
The member should be hidden everywhere.

* `Where.OBJECT_FORMS` +
+
The member should be hidden when displayed within an object form.
For most viewers, this applies to property and collection members,
not actions.

* `Where.PARENTED_TABLES` +
+
The member should be hidden when displayed as a column of a table
within a parent object's collection. For most (all?) viewers, this
will have meaning only if applied to a property member.

* `Where.STANDALONE_TABLES` +
+
The member should be hidden when displayed as a column of a table
showing a standalone list of objects, for example as returned by a
repository query. For most (all?) viewers, this will have meaning
only if applied to a property member.

* `Where.ALL_TABLES` +
+
The member should be /hidden when displayed as a column of a table,
either an object's * collection or a standalone list. This combines
`PARENTED_TABLES` and `STANDALONE_TABLES`.

* `Where.NOWHERE` +
+
Acts as an override if a member would normally be hidden as a result
of some other convention. For example, if a property is annotated
with `@Title` <!--(see ?)-->, then normally this should be hidden from all
tables. Additionally annotating with `@Hidden(where=Where.NOWHERE)`
overrides this.

The acceptable values for the `when` parameter are:

* `When.ALWAYS` +
+
The member should be hidden at all times.

* `When.NEVER` +
+
The member should never be hidden (unless disabled through some
other mechanism, for example an imperative disableXxx() supporting
method)..

* `When.ONCE_PERSISTED` +
+
The member should be visible for transient objects, but hidden for
persisted objects.

* `When.UNTIL_PERSISTED` +
+
The member should be hidden for transient objects, but visible for
persisted objects.

By default the annotated property or action is always hidden (ie
defaults to `Where.ANYWHERE`, `When.ALWAYS`).






== anchor:reference-annotations_manpage-Collection[]`notPersisted()`

IMPORTANT: WIP ... this section

The `@NotPersisted` annotation indicates that the property is not to be
persisted.


[TIP]
====
In many cases the same thing can be achieved simply by providing the property with a 'getter' but no 'setter'.
====

For example:

[source,java]
----
public class Order {

    @NotPersisted
    public Order getPreviousOrder() {...}
    public void setPreviousOrder(Order previousOrder) {...}

    ...
}
----









== anchor:reference-annotations_manpage-Collection[]`typeOf()`

IMPORTANT: WIP ... this section


The `@TypeOf` annotation is used to specify the type of elements in a collection, when for whatever reason it is not possible to use generics.

[NOTE]
====
Given that Apache Isis only supports Java 1.7 and later, it's not that obvious what such a reason might be...
====


For example:

[source,java]
----
public void AccountService {
    @TypeOf(Customer.class)
    public List errantAccounts() {
        return CustomerDatabase.allNewCustomers();
    }
    ...
}
----
