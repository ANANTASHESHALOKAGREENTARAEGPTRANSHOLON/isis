== `cssClassFa()

IMPORTANT: WIP ... this section


The `CssClassFa` annotation applies to objects and also to object actions,
and is used by the Wicket viewer as a UI hint.

For object actions, the viewer will render the specified
http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/icons/[Font Awesome icon]
on the action's button (or menu item).

For objects, it will be used as an icon. Note that this is only used if
the object does not have a `getIconName()` method.

For example:

[source,java]
----
@CssClassFa("fa-check-circle")
public class ToDoItem { ... }
----

or

[source,java]
----
public class ToDoItem {

    @CssClass("fa-step-backward")
    public ToDoItem previous() { ... }

    @CssClass("fa-step-forward")
    public ToDoItem next() { ... }

}
----

There can be multiple "fa-" classes, eg to mirror or rotate the icon. There
is no need to include the "fa" class; it will be automatically appended.

=== Alternatives (`.layout.json`)

As an alternative to using the `@CssClass` annotation, the `.layout.json` xref:_ug_wicket-viewer_layout_dynamic-object-layout[dynamic layout file]
can be specified, eg:

[source,javascript]
----
{
    "span": 6,
    "memberGroups": {
        "Priority": {
            "members": {
                ...
                 "relativePriority": {
                    "actions": {
                        "previous": {
                            "cssClassFa": { "value": "fa-step-backward" }
                        },
                        "next": {
                            "cssClassFa": { "value": "fa-step-forward" }
                        }
                    }
                },
                ....
            }
        },
        ...
    }
}
----

Note that this (currently) only supports class members, not classes.



[NOTE]
====
The similar xref:_ug_reference-annotations_manpage_ViewModelLayout_cssClass[`@ViewModelLayout#cssClass()`] annotation attribute is also used as a hint to apply CSS, but for wrapping the representation of an object or object member so that it can be styled in an application-specific way.
