IMPORTANT: WIP ... this section


The `@MustSatisfy` annotation allows validation to be applied to parameters using an (implementation of a) `org.apache.isis.applib.spec.Specification` object.

For example:

[source,java]
----
public class CustomerRepository {
    public Customer newCustomer(
            @MustSatisfy(StartWithCapitalLetterSpecification.class)
            @Named("First Name") firstName
           ,@MustSatisfy(StartWithCapitalLetterSpecification.class)
            @Named("Last Name") lastName) {
        ...
    }
    ...
}
----

The `Specification` is consulted during validation, being passed the
proposed value.

An alternative to using `@MustSatisfy` is to define a custom value type (though this introduces additional mapping complexity for both viewers and objectstore).


[TIP]
====
Can also specify on property, so the specification class can be reused.
