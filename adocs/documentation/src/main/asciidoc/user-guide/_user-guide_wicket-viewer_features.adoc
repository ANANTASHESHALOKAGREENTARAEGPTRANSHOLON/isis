This section discusses features of the wicket viewer from the perspective of an end-user actually using your Isis application.

== File upload/download

The Isis application library provides the <<_blob, Blob>> value type (binary large objects) and also the <<_clob, Clob>>
value type (character large object), each of which also includes metadata about the data (specifically the filename and mime type).

A class can define a property using either of these types, for example:

==== View mode, empty

`Blob` field rendered as attachment (with no data):

image::{_imagesdir}wicket-viewer/file-upload-download/010-attachment-field-940.png[width="800px",link="{_imagesdir}wicket-viewer/file-upload-download/010-attachment-field.png"]

==== Edit mode

Hit edit; 'choose file' button appears:

image::{_imagesdir}wicket-viewer/file-upload-download/020-edit-choose-file-940.png[width="800px",link="{_imagesdir}wicket-viewer/file-upload-download/020-edit-choose-file.png"]

==== Choose file

Choose file using the regular browser window:

image::{_imagesdir}wicket-viewer/file-upload-download/030-choose-file-using-browser-520.png[width="520px",link="{_imagesdir}wicket-viewer/file-upload-download/030-choose-file-using-browser.png"]


Chosen file is indicated:

image::{_imagesdir}wicket-viewer/file-upload-download/040-edit-chosen-file-indicated-940.png[width="800px",link="{_imagesdir}wicket-viewer/file-upload-download/040-edit-chosen-file-indicated.png"]

==== Image rendered

Back in view mode (ie once hit OK) if the `Blob` is an image, then it is shown:

image::{_imagesdir}wicket-viewer/file-upload-download/050-ok-if-image-then-rendered-940.png[width="800px",link="{_imagesdir}wicket-viewer/file-upload-download/050-ok-if-image-then-rendered.png"]

==== Download

`Blob` can be downloaded:

image::{_imagesdir}wicket-viewer/file-upload-download/060-download-940.png[width="800px",link="{_imagesdir}wicket-viewer/file-upload-download/060-download.png"]

==== Clear

Back in edit mode, can choose a different file or clear (assuming property is not mandatory):

image::{_imagesdir}wicket-viewer/file-upload-download/070-edit-clear-940.png[width="800px",link="{_imagesdir}wicket-viewer/file-upload-download/070-edit-clear.png"]

=== Domain Code

To define a `Blob`, use:

[source,java]
----
private Blob attachment;
@javax.jdo.annotations.Persistent(defaultFetchGroup="false")
    @javax.jdo.annotations.Persistent(defaultFetchGroup="false", columns = {
            @javax.jdo.annotations.Column(name = "attachment_name"),
            @javax.jdo.annotations.Column(name = "attachment_mimetype"),
            @javax.jdo.annotations.Column(name = "attachment_bytes", jdbcType = "BLOB", sqlType = "BLOB")
    })
@Property(
        domainEvent = AttachmentDomainEvent.class,
        optionality = Optionality.OPTIONAL
)
public Blob getAttachment() { return attachment; }
public void setAttachment(final Blob attachment) { this.attachment = attachment; }
----

To define a `Clob`, use:

[source,java]
----
private Clob doc;
@javax.jdo.annotations.Persistent(defaultFetchGroup="false", columns = {
        @javax.jdo.annotations.Column(name = "doc_name"),
        @javax.jdo.annotations.Column(name = "doc_mimetype"),
        @javax.jdo.annotations.Column(name = "doc_chars", jdbcType = "CLOB", sqlType = "CLOB")
})
@Property(
        optionality = Optionality.OPTIONAL
)
public Clob getDoc() { return doc; }
public void setDoc(final Clob doc) { this.doc = doc; }
----

The `Blob` and `Clob` types can also be used as parameters to actions.




== Bookmarked pages

The Wicket viewer supports the bookmarking of both domain objects and query-only (<<_actionsemantics, @ActionSemantics>>) actions.

Domain objects, if bookmarkable, can be nested.

Bookmarking is automatic; whenever a bookmarkable object/action is visited, then a bookmark is created. To avoid the number of bookmarks from indefinitely growing, bookmarks that have not been followed after a whle are automatically removed (an MRU/LRU algorithm). The number of bookmarks to preserve can be configured.

=== Screenshots

The following screenshot, taken from https://github.com/isisaddons/isis-app-todoapp[Isisaddons example todoapp] (not ASF) shows how the bookmarks are listed in a sliding panel.

image::{_imagesdir}wicket-viewer/bookmarked-pages/panel.png[width="800px",link="{_imagesdir}wicket-viewer/bookmarked-pages/panel.png"]

[NOTE]
====
TODO: this screenshot need to be updated for the new look-n-feel introduced in 1.8.0
====

Note how the list contains both domain objects and an action ("not yet complete").

Bookmarks can also form a hierarchy.  The following screenshot, also taken from the https://github.com/estatio/estatio[Estatio] application, shows a variety of different bookmarked objects with a nested structure:

image::{_imagesdir}wicket-viewer/bookmarked-pages/panel-estatio.png[width="800px",link="{_imagesdir}wicket-viewer/bookmarked-pages/panel-estatio.png"]

[NOTE]

====

Some - like `Property`, `Lease` and `Party` - are root nodes. However, `LeaseItem` is bookmarkable as a child of `Lease`, and `LeaseTerm` is bookmarkable only as a child of `LeaseItem`. This parent/child relationship is reflected in the layout.

=== Domain Code

To indicate a class is bookmarkable, use the <<_domainobjectlayout, @DomainObjectLayout>> annotation:

[source,java]
----
@DomainObjectLayout(
    bookmarking=BookmarkPolicy.AS_ROOT
)
public class Lease { ... }
----

To indicate a class is bookmarkable but only as a child of some parent bookmark, specify the bookmark policy:

[source,java]
----
@DomainObjectLayout(
    bookmarking=BookmarkPolicy.AS_CHILD
)
public class LeaseItem { ... }
----

To indicate that a safe (query only) action is bookmarkable, use the <<_actionlayout, @ActionLayout>> annotation:

[source,java]
----
public class ToDoItem ... {
    ...
    @ActionLayout(
         bookmarking=BookmarkPolicy.AS_ROOT
     )
    @ActionSemantics(Of.SAFE)
    public List<ToDoItem> notYetComplete() { ... }
    ...
}
----

[NOTE]
====
The BookmarkPolicy.AS_CHILD does not have a meaning for actions; if the `bookmarking` attribute is set to any other value, it will be ignored.
====

=== User Experience

The sliding panel appears whenever the mouse pointer hovers over the thin blue tab (to the left of the top header region).

Alternatively, `alt+[` will toggle open/close the panel; it can also be closed using `Esc` key.

=== Related functionality

The <<_recent_pages, Recent Pages>> also lists recently visited pages, selected from a drop-down.

=== Configuration

By default, the bookmarked pages panel will show a maximum of 15 'root' pages. This can be overridden using a property (in `isis.properties`), for example:

[source,ini]
----
isis.viewer.wicket.bookmarkedPages.maxSize=20
----



== Recent pages (drop down)

The Wicket viewer provides a recent pages drop-down that acts as a breadcrumb trail. Using it, the user can quickly open a recently accessed domain object.

=== Screenshots

The following screenshot, taken from the https://github.com/estatio/estatio[Estatio] application, shows the recent pages drop-down after a number of pages have been accessed.

image::{_imagesdir}wicket-viewer/recent-pages/recent-pages.png[width="800px",link="{_imagesdir}wicket-viewer/recent-pages/recent-pages.png"]


[NOTE]
====
TODO: this screenshot need to be updated for the new look-n-feel introduced in 1.8.0
====

=== Domain Code

The recent pages drop-down is automatically populated; no changes need to be made to the domain classes.

=== User Experience

Selecting the domain object from the list causes the viewer to automatically navigate to the page for the selected object.

=== Related functionality

The <<_bookmarked_pages, bookmarked pages>> (sliding panel) also provides links to recently visited objects, but only those explicitly marked as `@DomainObject(bookmarking=...)`.  The bookmarks panel also nests related objects together hierarchically (the recent pages drop-down does not).

=== Configuration

The number of objects is hard-coded as 10; it cannot currently be configured.





== Hints and copy URL

While the user can often copy the URL of a domain object directly from the browser's address bar, the Wicket viewer also allows the URL of domain objects to be easily copied from a dialog.

More interestingly, this URL can also contain hints capturing any sorting or page numbering, or hiding/viewing of collections.  End-users can therefore share these URLs as a form of deep linking into a particular view on a domain object.

The copy URL and hinting is automatic.

=== Screenshots

The following screenshots are taken from the [Estatio](https://github.com/estatio/estatio) application.

[NOTE]
====
TODO: these screenshots need to be updated for the new look-n-feel introduced in 1.8.0
====

==== Copy URL

This screenshot shows the copy URL button (top right):

image::{_imagesdir}wicket-viewer/copy-link/010-copy-link-button.png[width="800px",link="{_imagesdir}wicket-viewer/copy-link/010-copy-link-button.png"]

Clicking on this button brings up a dialog with the URL preselected:

image::{_imagesdir}wicket-viewer/copy-link/020-copy-link-dialog.png[width="800px",link="{_imagesdir}wicket-viewer/copy-link/020-copy-link-dialog.png"]


The URL in this case is something like:

    http://localhost:8080/wicket/entity/org.estatio.dom.lease.Lease:0

The user can copy the link (eg `ctrl+C`) into the clipboard, then hit `OK` or `Esc` to dismiss the dialog.

==== Hints

Using the viewer the user can hide/show collection tables, can sort the tables by header columns:

image::{_imagesdir}wicket-viewer/copy-link/030-hints.png[width="800px",link="{_imagesdir}wicket-viewer/copy-link/030-hints.png"]


Also, if the collection spans multiple pages, then the individual page can be selected.

Once the view has been customised, the URL shown in the copy URL dialog is in an extended form:

image::{_imagesdir}wicket-viewer/copy-link/040-copy-link-with-hints.png[width="800px",link="{_imagesdir}wicket-viewer/copy-link/040-copy-link-with-hints.png"]

The URL in this case is something like:

    http://localhost:8080/wicket/entity/org.estatio.dom.lease.Lease:0?hint-1:collectionContents-view=3&hint-1:collectionContents:collectionContents-3:table-DESCENDING=value&hint-1:collectionContents:collectionContents-3:table-pageNumber=0&hint-2:collectionContents-view=0&hint-2:collectionContents:collectionContents-2:table-pageNumber=0&hint-3:collectionContents-view=2&hint-3:collectionContents:collectionContents-2:table-pageNumber=0&hint-4:collectionContents-view=3&hint-4:collectionContents:collectionContents-3:table-ASCENDING=exerciseDate&hint-4:collectionContents:collectionContents-3:table-pageNumber=0&hint-5:collectionContents-view=0&hint-5:collectionContents:collectionContents-3:table-pageNumber=0

==== Copy URL from title

When the user invokes an action on the object, the URL (necessarily) changes to indicate that the action was invoked.  This URL is specific to the user's session and cannot be shared with others.

A quick way for the user to grab a shareable URL is simply by clicking on the object's title:

image::{_imagesdir}wicket-viewer/copy-link/050-title-url.png[width="800px",link="{_imagesdir}wicket-viewer/copy-link/050-title-url.png"]


=== User Experience

The copy URL dialog is typically obtained by clicking on the icon.

Alternatively, `alt+]` will also open the dialog.  It can be closed with either `OK` or the `Esc` key.







== User Registration
