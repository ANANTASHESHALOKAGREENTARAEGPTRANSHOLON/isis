This section discusses features of the wicket viewer from the perspective of an end-user actually using your Isis application.

IMPORTANT: TODO



== Bookmarked pages

The Wicket viewer supports the bookmarking of both domain objects and query-only (<<_actionsemantics, @ActionSemantics>>) actions.

Domain objects, if bookmarkable, can be nested.

Bookmarking is automatic; whenever a bookmarkable object/action is visited, then a bookmark is created. To avoid the number of bookmarks from indefinitely growing, bookmarks that have not been followed after a whle are automatically removed (an MRU/LRU algorithm). The number of bookmarks to preserve can be configured.

=== Screenshots

The following screenshot, taken from https://github.com/isisaddons/isis-app-todoapp[Isisaddons example todoapp] (not ASF) shows how the bookmarks are listed in a sliding panel.

Note how the list contains both domain objects and an action ("not yet complete").

Bookmarks can also form a hierarchy.  The following screenshot, also taken from the https://github.com/estatio/estatio[Estatio] application, shows a variety of different bookmarked objects with a nested structure:

Some - like `Property`, `Lease` and `Party` - are root nodes. However, `LeaseItem` is bookmarkable as a child of `Lease`, and `LeaseTerm` is bookmarkable only as a child of `LeaseItem`. This parent/child relationship is reflected in the layout.

=== Domain Code

To indicate a class is bookmarkable, use the <<_domainobjectlayout, @DomainObjectLayout>> annotation:

[source,java]
----
@DomainObjectLayout(
    bookmarking=BookmarkPolicy.AS_ROOT
)
public class Lease { ... }
----

To indicate a class is bookmarkable but only as a child of some parent bookmark, specify the bookmark policy:

[source,java]
----
@DomainObjectLayout(
    bookmarking=BookmarkPolicy.AS_CHILD
)
public class LeaseItem { ... }
----

To indicate that a safe (query only) action is bookmarkable, use the <<_actionlayout, @ActionLayout>> annotation:

[source,java]
----
public class ToDoItem ... {
    ...
    @ActionLayout(
         bookmarking=BookmarkPolicy.AS_ROOT
     )
    @ActionSemantics(Of.SAFE)
    public List<ToDoItem> notYetComplete() { ... }
    ...
}
----

[NOTE]
====
The BookmarkPolicy.AS_CHILD does not have a meaning for actions; if the `bookmarking` attribute is set to any other value, it will be ignored.
====

=== User Experience

The sliding panel appears whenever the mouse pointer hovers over the thin blue tab (to the left of the top header region).

Alternatively, `alt+[` will toggle open/close the panel; it can also be closed using `Esc` key.

=== Related functionality

The <<_recent_pages, Recent Pages>> also lists recently visited pages, selected from a drop-down.

=== Configuration

By default, the bookmarked pages panel will show a maximum of 15 'root' pages. This can be overridden using a property (in `isis.properties`), for example:

[source,ini]
----
isis.viewer.wicket.bookmarkedPages.maxSize=20
----
