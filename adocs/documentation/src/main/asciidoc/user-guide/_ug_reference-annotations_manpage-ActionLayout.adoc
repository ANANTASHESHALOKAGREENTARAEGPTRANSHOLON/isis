== anchor:reference-annotations_manpage-ActionLayout[]`bookmarking()`

IMPORTANT: WIP ... this section

The `@Bookmarkable` annotation indicates that an entity or an action (with safe link:./ActionSemantics.html[action semantics]) is automatically bookmarked.

(In the Wicket viewer), a link to a bookmarked object is shown in the bookmarks panel that slides out from the left:

<img src="images/Bookmarkable.png" width="640px"/>

For example:

[source,java]
----
@Bookmarkable
public class ToDoItem ... {
    ...
}
----

indicates that the `ToDoItem` class is bookmarkable, while:

[source,java]
----
@Named("ToDos")
public class ToDoItems {

    @Bookmarkable
    @ActionSemantics(Of.SAFE)
    @MemberOrder(sequence = "1")
    public List<ToDoItem> notYetComplete() {
        ...
    }

}
----

indicates that the "not yet complete" action is bookmarkable.

It is also possible to nest bookmarkable entities. For example, this screenshot is taken from http://github.com/estatio/estatio[Estatio]:

<img src="images/Bookmarkable-nested.png" width="640px"/>

For example, the `Property` entity "[OXF] Oxford Super Mall" is a root bookmark (the default), but the `Unit` child entity "[OXF-001] Unit 1" only appears as a bookmark if its parent `Property` has already been visited. This is accomplished with the following annotations:

[source,java]
----
@Bookmarkable
public class Property { ... }
----

and

[source,java]
----
@Bookmarkable(BookmarkPolicy.AS_CHILD)
public abstract class Unit { ... }
----

The nesting can be done to any level; the Estatio screenshot also shows a bookmark nesting 3 deep: `Lease` -&gt; `LeaseItem` -&gt; `LeaseTerm`.

[NOTE]
====
Replaces deprecated `@Bookmarkable` annotation.

== anchor:reference-annotations_manpage-ActionLayout[]`contributedAs()`

IMPORTANT: WIP ... this section

The `@NotContributed` annotation applies only to action methods, and
specifically to the actions of services. If present, it indicates that
the action should not be contributed to any of its domain object
arguments.

For example:

[source,java]
----
public class OrderServices {
    @NotContributed
    public void cancel(Order order);
    ...
}
----

If the action should neither be contributed nor appear in the service's
service menu, then you could instead simply mark it as `@Hidden`.

=== Contributing of one-arg actions

Actions that accept a single argument will, by default, also be contributed as an association:

* if the action returns a single object (value or entity) then the action will be contributed as a property
* if the action returns a list then the action will be contributed as a collection

This behaviour can be influenced by specifying the "As." attribute:

* use `@NotContributed(As.ACTION)` to contribute the action as an association
* use `@NotContributed(As.ASSOCIATION)` to contribute the action as an action
* use `@NotContributed` to not contribute the action at all.


[NOTE]
====
Replaces the deprecated `@NotContributed` annotation.
====









== anchor:reference-annotations_manpage-ActionLayout[]`cssClass()`

IMPORTANT: WIP ... this section


The `CssClass` annotation applies to object and also to any object member (property, collection or action). It is used by the Wicket viewer as a UI hint to render specified CSS classes around the representation of the element.

Application-specific CSS can then be used to target and adjust the UI representation of that particular element.

For example:

[source,java]
----
@CssClass("x-main")
public class ToDoItem { ... }
----

or

[source,java]
----
public class ToDoItem {

    @CssClass("x-key")
    public LocalDate getDueBy() { ... }

}
----


=== Alternatives (`.layout.json`)

As an alternative to using the `@CssClass` annotation, the `.layout.json`
link:../../components/viewers/wicket/dynamic-layouts.html[dynamic layout file]
can be specified, eg:

[source,javascript]
----
{
    "span": 6,
    "memberGroups": {
        "Priority": {
            "members": {
                ...
                "dueBy": {
                    "cssClass": { "value": "x-key" }
                }
                ....
            }
        },
        ...
    }
}
----

Note that this (currently) only supports class members, not classes


[NOTE]
====
The similar link:./CssClassFa-deprecated.html[CssClassFa] annotation is also used as a hint
to apply CSS, but in particular to allow http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/icons/[Font Awesome icons]
to be rendered on action butotns or as the icon for classes.
====







== anchor:reference-annotations_manpage-ActionLayout[]`cssClassFa()`

IMPORTANT: WIP ... this section



The `CssClassFa` annotation applies to objects and also to object actions,
and is used by the Wicket viewer as a UI hint.

For object actions, the viewer will render the specified
http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/icons/[Font Awesome icon]
on the action's button (or menu item).

For objects, it will be used as an icon. Note that this is only used if
the object does not have a `getIconName()` method.

For example:

[source,java]
----
@CssClassFa("fa-check-circle")
public class ToDoItem { ... }
----

or

[source,java]
----
public class ToDoItem {

    @CssClass("fa-step-backward")
    public ToDoItem previous() { ... }

    @CssClass("fa-step-forward")
    public ToDoItem next() { ... }

}
----

There can be multiple "fa-" classes, eg to mirror or rotate the icon. There
is no need to include the "fa" class; it will be automatically appended.

=== Alternatives (`.layout.json`)

As an alternative to using the `@CssClass` annotation, the `.layout.json`
link:../../components/viewers/wicket/dynamic-layouts.html[dynamic layout file]
can be specified, eg:

[source,javascript]
----
{
    "span": 6,
    "memberGroups": {
        "Priority": {
            "members": {
                ...
                 "relativePriority": {
                    "actions": {
                        "previous": {
                            "cssClassFa": { "value": "fa-step-backward" }
                        },
                        "next": {
                            "cssClassFa": { "value": "fa-step-forward" }
                        }
                    }
                },
                ....
            }
        },
        ...
    }
}
----

Note that this (currently) only supports class members, not classes.


[NOTE]
====
The similar link:./CssClass-deprecated.html[CssClass] annotation is also used as a hint to apply CSS, but for wrapping the representation of an object or object member so that it can be styled in an application-specific way.
====









== anchor:reference-annotations_manpage-ActionLayout[]`describedAs()`

IMPORTANT: WIP ... this section


The `@DescribedAs` annotation is used to provide a short description of something that features on the user interface. How this description is used will depend upon the viewing mechanism - but it may be thought of as being like a 'tool tip'.

Descriptions may be provided for objects, members (properties, collections and actions), and for individual parameters within an action method. `@DescribedAs` therefore works in a very similar manner to `@Named` <!--(see ?)-->.

For example:

[source,java]
----
public class Customer {
    @DescribedAs("Place a repeat order of the last (most recently placed) order")
    public Order placeRepeatOrder(...) { ... }
}
----







== anchor:reference-annotations_manpage-ActionLayout[]`hidden()`

IMPORTANT: WIP ... this section


The `@Hidden` annotation indicates that the member (property, collection or action) to which it is applied should never be visible to the user. It can also be applied to service types (it has no effect if applied to entities or values).

For example:

[source,java]
----
public class Customer {
    @Hidden
    public int getInternalId() { ... }

    @Hidden
    public void updateStatus() { ... }
    ...
}
----

Or, applied to a service:

[source,java]
----
@Hidden
public class EmailService {
    public void sendEmail(...) { ... }
    ...
}
----

This annotation can also take a parameters indicating where and when it
is to be hidden. For example:

[source,java]
----
public class Customer {
    @Hidden(when=When.ONCE_PERSISTED)
    public int getInternalId() { ... }
    ...
}
----

would show the `Id` until the object has been saved, and then would hide
it. And:

[source,java]
----
public class Customer {
    @Hidden(where=Where.ALL_TABLES)
    public int getDateOfBirth() { ... }
    ...
}
----

would suppress the `dateOfBirth` property of a Customer from all tables.

The acceptable values for the `where` parameter are:

* `Where.ANYWHERE` +
+
The member should be hidden everywhere.

* `Where.OBJECT_FORMS` +
+
The member should be hidden when displayed within an object form.
For most viewers, this applies to property and collection members,
not actions.

* `Where.PARENTED_TABLES` +
+
The member should be hidden when displayed as a column of a table
within a parent object's collection. For most (all?) viewers, this
will have meaning only if applied to a property member.

* `Where.STANDALONE_TABLES` +
+
The member should be hidden when displayed as a column of a table
showing a standalone list of objects, for example as returned by a
repository query. For most (all?) viewers, this will have meaning
only if applied to a property member.

* `Where.ALL_TABLES` +
+
The member should be /hidden when displayed as a column of a table,
either an object's * collection or a standalone list. This combines
`PARENTED_TABLES` and `STANDALONE_TABLES`.

* `Where.NOWHERE` +
+
Acts as an override if a member would normally be hidden as a result
of some other convention. For example, if a property is annotated
with `@Title` <!--(see ?)-->, then normally this should be hidden from all
tables. Additionally annotating with `@Hidden(where=Where.NOWHERE)`
overrides this.

The acceptable values for the `when` parameter are:

* `When.ALWAYS` +
+
The member should be hidden at all times.

* `When.NEVER` +
+
The member should never be hidden (unless disabled through some
other mechanism, for example an imperative disableXxx() supporting
method)..

* `When.ONCE_PERSISTED` +
+
The member should be visible for transient objects, but hidden for
persisted objects.

* `When.UNTIL_PERSISTED` +
+
The member should be hidden for transient objects, but visible for
persisted objects.

By default the annotated property or action is always hidden (ie
defaults to `Where.ANYWHERE`, `When.ALWAYS`).







== anchor:reference-annotations_manpage-ActionLayout[]`named()`

IMPORTANT: WIP ... this section

The `@Named` annotation is used when you want to specify the way
something is named on the user interface i.e. when you do not want to
use the name generated automatically by the system. It can be applied to
objects, members (properties, collections, and actions) and to
parameters within an action method.


[WARNING]
====
Generally speaking it is better to rename the property, collection or action. The only common case where `@Named` is common is to rename parameters for built-in value types. Even here though a custom value type can be defined using `@Value` so that the value type is used as the parameter name. `@Named` may also be used if the name needs punctuation or other symbols in the name presented to the user.
====



=== Specifying the name of an object

By default the name of an object is derived, reflectively from the class
name. To specify a different name for an object, use the `@Named`
annotation in front of the class declaration.

For example:

[source,java]
----
@Named("Customer")
public class CustomerImpl implements Customer{
   ...
}
----

See also the `@Plural` annotation <!--, ?-->.

=== Specifying the name of a class member

By default, the name of a class member (a property, collection or
action) presented to the user is derived, reflectively, from the name of
the member defined in the program code. To specify a different name use
the `@Named
`annotation immediately before the member declaration.

For example:

[source,java]
----
public class Customer {

    public String getFirstName() { ... }

    public String getSurname() { ... }

    public CreditRating getCreditRating() { ... }
}
----

Note that the framework provides a separate and more powerful mechanism
for internationalisation.

=== Specifying the name for an action parameter

The most common usage of `@Named` is be to specify names for the
parameters of an action. This is because the parameter name declared in
the code for the action method cannot be picked up reflectively (by
default, the user interface will use the type of the parameter as the
name; for a `String` or a `Boolean`, this is almost certainly not what is
required).

To specify the name of a parameter, the `@Named` annotation is applied
'in-line' (i.e. preceding the individual parameter declaration.

For example:

[source,java]
----
public class Customer {
    public Order placeOrder(
            Product product
           ,@Named("Quantity")
            int quantity) {
        Order order = newTransientInstance(Order.class);
        order.modifyCustomer(this);
        order.modifyProduct(product);
        order.setQuantity(quantity);
        return order;
    }
    ...
}
----

An alternative is to use a value type (though this introduces additional mapping complexity for both viewers and objectstore).
