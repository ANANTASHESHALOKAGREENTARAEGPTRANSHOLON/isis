The metadata for domain objects is obtained both xref:_static_object_layout[statically] and xref:_dynamic_object_layout[dynamically].

The default implementation for reading dynamic layout metadata is `org.apache.isis.core.metamodel.layoutmetadata.json.LayoutMetadataReaderFromJson`, which is responsible for reading from the `Xxx.layout.json` files on the classpath (for each domain entity `Xxx`).

You can also implement your own metadata readers and plug them into Isis.  These could read from a different file format, or they could, even, read data dynamically from a URL or database.  (Indeed, one could imagine an implementation whereby users could share layouts, all stored in some central repository).



== API and Implementation

Any reader must implement Isis' internal `LayoutMetadataReader` interface:

[source,java]
----
public interface LayoutMetadataReader {
    public Properties asProperties(Class<?> domainClass) throws ReaderException;
}
----

The implementation "simply" returns a set of properties where the property key is a unique identifier to both the class member and also the facet of the class member to which the metadata relates.

See the implementation of the built-in `LayoutMetadataReaderFromJson` for more detail.



== Configuration

Once you have implemented your validator, you must register it with the framework by defining the appropriate configuration property:

[source,ini]
----
isis.reflector.layoutMetadataReaders=\
           com.mycompany.myapp.MyMetaModelValidator,\
           org.apache.isis.core.metamodel.layoutmetadata.json.LayoutMetadataReaderFromJson   # <1>
----
<1> the property replaces any existing metadata readers; if you want to preserve the ability to read from `Xxx.layout.json` then also register Isis' built-in implementation.
