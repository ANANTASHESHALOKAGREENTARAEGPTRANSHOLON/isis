IMPORTANT: WIP ... this section


The `CssClass` annotation applies to object and also to any object member (property, collection or action). It is used by the Wicket viewer as a UI hint to render specified CSS classes around the representation of the element.

[NOTE]
====
This attribute can also be applied to xref:_ug_reference-annotations_manpage-DomainObjectLayout_cssClass[domain objects], xref:_ug_reference-annotations_manpage-ViewModelLayout_cssClass[view models], xref:_ug_reference-annotations_manpage-ActionLayout_cssClass[actions] xref:_ug_reference-annotations_manpage-CollectionLayout_cssClass[collections] and xref:_ug_reference-annotations_manpage-ParameterLayout_cssClass[action parameters].
====

Application-specific CSS can then be used to target and adjust the UI representation of that particular element.

For example:

[source,java]
----
public class ToDoItem {

    @CssClass("x-key")
    public LocalDate getDueBy() { ... }

}
----




As an alternative to using the annotation, the dynamic xref:_ug_wicket-viewer_layout_dynamic-object-layout[`.layout.json`]
can be used instead, eg:

[source,javascript]
----
{
    "span": 6,
    "memberGroups": {
        "Priority": {
            "members": {
                ...
                "dueBy": {
                    "cssClass": { "value": "x-key" }
                }
                ....
            }
        },
        ...
    }
}
----

Note that this (currently) only supports class members, not classes


[NOTE]
====
The similar xref:_ug_reference-annotations_manpage-PropertyLayout_cssClassFa[`@PropertyLayout#cssClassFa()`] attribute is also used as a hint to apply CSS, but in particular to allow http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/icons/[Font Awesome icons] to be rendered on action butotns or as the icon for classes.
