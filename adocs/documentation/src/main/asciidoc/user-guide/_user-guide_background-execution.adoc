As well as supporting the Wicket viewer and Restful viewer for "online" access, Apache Isis also supports programmatic access.  The API provided is low-level and allows code to interact very directly with the Isis metamodel and runtime.  Howwever the <<WrapperFactory>> service could be used to enforce business rules if required.

Typical use cases are to support batch execution or background scheduler execution (eg using http://quartz-scheduler.org[Quartz]) . It could also be used to run Isis as a service, or to integrate within a JMS/ESB messaging solutions.

== AbstractIsisSessionTemplate

The `AbstractIsisSessionTemplate` class (whose name is inspired by the Spring framework's naming convention for similar classes that query http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/2.5.x/reference/jdbc.html#jdbc-JdbcTemplate[JDBC], http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/2.5.x/reference/jms.html#jms-jmstemplate[JMS], http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/2.5.x/reference/orm.html#orm-jpa-template[JPA] etc.) provides the mechanism to open up a 'session' within the Isis framework, in order to resolve and interact with entities.

The class itself is intended to be subclassed:

[source,java]
----
public abstract class AbstractIsisSessionTemplate {

    public void execute(final AuthenticationSession authSession, final Object context) { ... } //<1>
    protected abstract void doExecute(Object context); // <2>

    protected ObjectAdapter adapterFor(final Object targetObject) { ... }
    protected ObjectAdapter adapterFor(final RootOid rootOid) { ... }

    protected PersistenceSession getPersistenceSession() { ... }
    protected IsisTransactionManager getTransactionManager() { ... }
    protected AdapterManager getAdapterManager() { ... }
}
----
<1> `execute(...)` sets up the `IsisSession` and delegates to ...
<2> `doExecute(...)`, the mandatory hook method for subclasses to implement.
The passed object represents passes a context from the caller (eg the scheduler, cron job, JMS etc) that instantiated and executed the class.

The `protected` methods expose key internal APIs within Isis, for the subclass to use as necessary.


TIP: One notable feature of `AbstractIsisSessionTemplate` is that it will automatically inject any domain services into itself. Thus, it is relatively easy for the subclass to "reach into" the domain, through injected repository services.




== BackgroundCommandExecution

The `BackgroundCommandExecution` class (a subclass of <<AbstractIsisSessionTemplate>>) is intended to simplify the execution of background ``Command``s persisted by way of the <<CommandService>> and the <<BackgroundCommandService>>.

Its signature is:

[source,java]
----
public abstract class BackgroundCommandExecution extends AbstractIsisSessionTemplate {
    protected void doExecute(Object context) { ... }
    protected abstract List<? extends Command> findBackgroundCommandsToExecute(); // <1>
}
----
<1> `findBackgroundCommandsToExecute()` is a mandatory hook method for subclasses to implement.

This allows for different implementations of the `CommandService` and `BackgroundCommandService` to persist to wherever.

=== Isis Addons Command Module

The `BackgroundCommandExecutionFromBackgroundCommandServiceJdo` is a concrete subclass of <<BackgroundCommandExecution>>, the intended use being for the class to be instantiated regularly (eg every 10 seconds) by a scheduler such as http://quartz-scheduler.org[Quartz]) to poll for ``Command``s to be executed, and then execute them.

This implementation queries for ``Command``s persisted by the http://isisaddons.org/isis-module-command[Isis addons Command Module]'s  implementations of <<CommandService>> and <<BackgroundCommandService>> using the `BackgroundCommandServiceJdoRepository`.

The diagram below shows the inheritance hierarchy for this class:
