IMPORTANT: WIP...

The Restful Objects viewer provides a number of configuration option that extend/simplify/alter the representations generated from the Restful Objects specification.

These configuration properties are typically stored in `WEB-INF/viewer_restfulobjects.properties`.  However, you can place all configuration properties into `WEB-INF/isis.properties` if you wish (the configuration properties from all config files are merged together).

[WARNING]
====
These configuration settings should be considered beta, and may change in the future in response to emerging requirements.

Also, be aware enabling these settings makes the representations with respect to the http://restfulobjects.org[Restful Object spec].  (Based on experience in Isis, in the future the spec may be updated to allow such extensions).

== Honor UI hints

By default the representations generated by Restful Objects ignore any Isis metamodel hints referring to the UI.
In particular, if a collection is annotated then `Render(EAGERLY)` then the contents of the collection are _not_
eagerly embedded in the object representation.

However, this behaviour can be overridden globally using following property (typically added to `WEB-INF/viewer_restfulobjects.properties`):

[source,ini]
----
isis.viewer.restfulobjects.honorUiHints=true
----

[NOTE]
====
In the future we might extend this per-request.  Raise/vote on a JIRA ticket if you require this feature.
====



== Suppressing elements of the representation

The representations specified by the http://restfulobjects.org[Restful Object spec] are very rich in hypermedia controls and metadata, intended to support a wide variety of possible REST clients. However, if an application is providing its REST API only for a small well-defined set of REST clients, then it is possible to suppress (remove) various elements of these representations.

This is done by globally using the following properties (typically added to `WEB-INF/viewer_restfulobjects.properties`):

[source,ini]
----
isis.viewer.restfulobjects.suppressDescribedByLinks=true      # <1>
isis.viewer.restfulobjects.suppressUpdateLink=true            # <2>
isis.viewer.restfulobjects.suppressMemberId=true              # <3>
isis.viewer.restfulobjects.suppressMemberLinks=true           # <4>
isis.viewer.restfulobjects.suppressMemberExtensions=true      # <5>
isis.viewer.restfulobjects.suppressMemberDisabledReason=true  # <6>
----
<1> suppresses the "describedby" links (on all representations)
<2> suppresses the  "update" link (on object representation)
<3> suppresses the  "id" json-prop for object members (on object representation and member detail representations)
<4> suppresses the  "links" json-prop for object members (on the object representation and member detail representations)
<5> suppresses the  "extensions" json-prop for object members (on the object representation and member detail representations)
<6> suppresses the  "disabledReason" json-prop for object members (on the object representation and member detail representations)

The defaults for all of these is false, meaning that the hypermedia/metadata is NOT suppressed.

In the future we might extend this per-request.  Raise/vote on a JIRA ticket if you require this feature.

If an even simpler representations (of objects) are required, see xref:_simplified_object_representation[simplified object representation], immediately below.  And if the above isn't flexible and you need complete control over all representations see the section on xref:_extending_the_restful_viewer[Extending the Restful viewer] in the <<Extending>> chapter.



== Simplified object representation

The representations specified by the http://restfulobjects.org[Restful Object spec] are very rich in hypermedia
controls and metadata, intended to support a wide variety of possible REST clients.

As described xref:_suppressing_elements_of_the_representations[above], it is possible to suppress various elements of these representations. Even then, though, the representations may be too complex for some bespoke REST clients that require a very "flat" object representation.

The Restful Objects viewer therefore supports generating a much simpler representation of objects using the following configuration property (typically added to `WEB-INF/viewer_restfulobjects.properties`):

[source,ini]
----
isis.viewer.restfulobjects.objectPropertyValuesOnly=true
----

This generates a representation such as:

[source,javascript]
----
{
    "title" : "Buy milk due by 2014-10-27",
    "domainType" : "TODO",
    "instanceId" : "0",
    "members" : {
        "description" : "Buy milk",
        "category" : "Domestic",
        "subcategory" : "Shopping",
        "complete" : false,
        "versionSequence" : 1,
        "relativePriority" : 2,
        "dueBy" : "2014-10-27",
        "cost" : "0.75",
        "notes" : null,
        "attachment" : null,
        "doc" : null
    },
    "links" : [
        {
            "rel" : "self",
            "href" : "http://localhost:8080/restful/objects/TODO/0",
            "method" : "GET",
            "type" : "application/json;profile=\"urn:org.restfulobjects:repr-types/object\"",
            "title" : "Buy milk due by 2014-10-27"
        },
        {
            "rel" : "describedby",
            "href" : "http://localhost:8080/restful/domain-types/TODO",
            "method" : "GET",
            "type" : "application/json;profile=\"urn:org.restfulobjects:repr-types/domain-type\""
        }
    ],
    "extensions" : {
        "oid" : "TODO:0"
    },
}
