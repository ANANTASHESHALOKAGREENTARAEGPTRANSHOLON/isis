Whenever a domain object (or list of domain objects) is to be rendered, the framework fires off multiple domain events for every property, collection and action of the domain object.  In the cases of the domain object's collections, the events that are fired are:

* hide phase: to check that the collection is visible (has not been hidden)
* disable phase: to check that the collection is usable (has not been disabled)
* validate phase: to check that the collection's arguments are valid (to add or remove an element)
* pre-execute phase: before the modification of the collection
* post-execute: after the modification of the collection

Subscribers subscribe through the xref:_ug_reference-services-api_manpage-EventBusService[`EventBusService`] using either link:https://github.com/google/guava[Guava] or link:http://www.axonframework.org/[Axon Framework] annotations and can influence each of these phases.


[WARNING]
====
The xref:_ug_wicket-viewer[Wicket viewer] does _not_ currently support the modification of collections; they are rendered read-only.  However, domain events are still relevant to determine if such collections should be hidden.

The workaround is to create add/remove actions and use xref:_ug_reference-annotations_manpage-MemberOrder[UI hints] to render them close to the collection.
====

By default the event raised is `CollectionDomainEvent.Default`. For example:

[source,java]
----
public class ToDoItem {
    @Collection()
    public SortedSet<ToDoItem> getDependencies() { ... }
    ...
}
----

The purpose of the `domainEvent()` attribute is to allows a custom subclass to be emitted instead.

[NOTE]
====
As you might expect, it is also possible to influence the domain event type raised for xref:_ug_reference-annotations_manpage-Action_domainEvent[actions] and xref:_ug_reference-annotations_manpage-Property_domainEvent[properties].
====


For example:

[source,java]
----
public class ToDoItem {
    public static class DependenciesChangedEvent
            extends CollectionDomainEvent<ToDoItem, ToDoItem> { // <1>
        private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;
        public DependenciesChangedEvent(                        // <2>
                ToDoItem source,                                // <3>
                Identifier identifier,                          // <4>
                Of of,                                          // <5>
                ToDoItem value) {                               // <6>
            super(source, identifier, of, value);
        }
    }
    @Collection(
        domainEvent=DependenciesChangedEvent.class
    )
    public SortedSet<ToDoItem> getDependencies() { ... }
    ...
}
----
<1> inherit from `CollectionDomainEvent<T,E>` where `T` is the type of the domain object being interacted with, and `E` is the type of the element in the collection (both `ToDoItem` in this example)
<2> constructor called reflectively by the framework
<3> populated with the object being interacted with (the source of the event)
<4> identifier of the collection
<5> indicates if the collection is being accessed, added to or removed from.
<6> the element being added or removed from the collection


The benefit is that subscribers can be more targetted as to the events that they subscribe to.



== Subscribers

Subscribers (which must be domain services) subscribe using either the link:https://github.com/google/guava[Guava] API or (if the xref:_ug_reference-services-api_manpage-EventBusService[`EventBusService`] has been appropriately configured) using the link:http://www.axonframework.org/[Axon Framework] API.  The examples below use the Guava API.

Subscribers can be either coarse-grained (if they subscribe to the top-level event type):

[source,java]
----
@DomainService
public class SomeSubscriber {
    @Programmatic
    @com.google.common.eventbus.Subscribe
    public void on(CollectionInteractionEvent ev) {
        ...
    }
}
----

or can be fine-grained (by subscribing to specific event subtypes):

[source,java]
----
@DomainService
public class SomeSubscriber {
    @Programmatic
    @com.google.common.eventbus.Subscribe
    public void on(ToDoItem.DependenciesChangedEvent ev) {
        ...
    }
}
----

[TIP]
====
If the AxonFramework is being used, replace `@com.google.common.eventbus.Subscribe` with `@org.axonframework.eventhandling.annotation.EventHandler`.
====

The subscriber's method is called (up to) 5 times:

* whether to veto visibility (hide)
* whether to veto usability (disable)
* whether to veto execution (validate) the element being added to/removed from the collection
* steps to perform prior to the collection being added to/removed from
* steps to perform after the collection has been added to/removed from.

The subscriber can distinguish these by calling `ev.getPhase()`. Thus the general form is:

[source,java]
----
@Programmatic
@com.google.common.eventbus.Subscribe
public void on(CollectionDomainEvent ev) {
    switch(ev.getPhase()) {
        case HIDE:
            // call ev.hide() or ev.veto("") to hide the collection
            break;
        case DISABLE:
            // call ev.disable("...") or ev.veto("...") to disable the collection
            break;
        case VALIDATE:
            // call ev.invalidate("...") or ev.veto("...")
            // if object being added/removed to collection is invalid
            break;
        case EXECUTING:
            break;
        case EXECUTED:
            break;
    }
}
----

It is also possible to abort the transaction during the executing or executed phases by throwing an exception. If the exception is a subtype of `RecoverableException` then the exception will be rendered as a user-friendly warning (eg Growl/toast) rather than an error.




== Raising events programmatically

Normally events are only raised for interactions through the UI. However, events can be raised programmatically either by calling the xref:_ug_reference-services-api_manpage-EventBusService[`EventBusService`] API directly, or by emulating the UI by
wrapping the target object using the xref:_ug_reference-services-api_manpage-WrapperFactory[`WrapperFactory`] domain service.
