IMPORTANT: WIP ... this section

[WARNING]
====
The Wicket viewer does NOT support collection modification; instead write a pair of actions to add to/remove from the collection.

However, it _is_ possible to fire collection interaction events using the wrapper factory; see below for more details.
====


The `@CollectionInteraction` annotation applies to domain entity collections, allowing subscribers to optionally veto, validate or otherwise perform tasks before or after the collection has been added to/removed from.

Subscribers subscribe through the xref:_ug_reference-services-api_manpage-EventBusService[`EventBusService`] using Guava annotations.

By default the event raised is `CollectionInteractionEvent.Default`. For example:

[source,java]
----
public class ToDoItem {
    ...
    @CollectionInteraction
    public SortedSet<ToDoItem> getDependencies() { ... }
}
----

Optionally a subclass can be declared:

[source,java]
----
public class ToDoItem {

    public static class DependenciesChangedEvent extends CollectionInteractionEvent<ToDoItem, ToDoItem> {
        private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;
        public DependenciesChangedEvent(ToDoItem source, Identifier identifier, Of of, ToDoItem value) {
            super(source, identifier, of, value);
        }
    }

}
----

The `of` field indicates if the collection is being accessed, added to or removed from.





== Subscribers

Subscribers (which must be domain services) subscribe using the Guava API.
Subscribers can be either coarse-grained (if they subscribe to the top-level event type):

[source,java]
----
@DomainService
public class SomeSubscriber {

    @Programmatic
    @com.google.common.eventbus.Subscribe
    public void on(CollectionInteractionEvent ev) {

        ...
    }

}
----

or can be fine-grained by subscribing to specific event subtypes:

[source,java]
----
@DomainService
public class SomeSubscriber {

    @Programmatic
    @com.google.common.eventbus.Subscribe
    public void on(ToDoItem.DependenciesChangedEvent ev) {

        ...
    }

}
----

The subscriber's method is called (up to) 5 times:

* whether to veto visibility (hide)
* whether to veto usability (disable)
* whether to veto execution (validate)
* steps to perform prior to the property being modified
* steps to perform after the property has been modified.

The subscriber can distinguish these by calling `ev.getPhase()`. Thus the general form is:

[source,java]
----
    @Programmatic
    @com.google.common.eventbus.Subscribe
    public void on(CollectionInteractionEvent ev) {

    switch(ev.getPhase()) {
        case HIDE:
            ...
            break;
        case DISABLE:
            ...
            break;
        case VALIDATE:
            ...
            break;
        case EXECUTING:
            ...
            break;
        case EXECUTED:
            ...
            break;
    }
}
----

Vetoing is performed by calling the appropriate method on the event:

*

To hide:

ev.hide()

*

To disable:

ev.disable("…");

*

To invalidate:

ev.invalidate("…");

It is also possible to abort the transaction during the executing or executed
phases by throwing an exception. If the exception is a subtype of `RecoverableException`
then the exception will be rendered as a user-friendly warning (eg Growl/toast)
rather than an error.




== Raising events programmatically.

Normally events are only raised for interactions through the UI. However, events can be raised programmatically by
wrapping the target object using the link:../services/wrapper-factory.html[Wrapper Factory] service.


[NOTE]
====
domain events can also be raised for actions and properties.
