The lifecycle callback methods notify a domain entity about its interaction within the persistence lifecycle.  For example, the entity is notified immediately prior to being persisted, or when it is about to be updated.

[WARNING]
====
We believe there may some scenarios (not yet fully catalogued) where the lifecycle method is not called.  As such we recommend that you don't rely on these methods and/or fully test they are called as required in your apps

As an alternative, consider using Isis' event bus and domain events.

The lifecycle methods are:
