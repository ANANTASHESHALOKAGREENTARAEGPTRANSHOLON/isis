Most framework domain services are API: they exist to provide support functionality to the application's domain objects and services.  In this case an implementation of the service will be available, either by Apache Isis itself or by Isis Addons (non ASF).

Some framework domain services are SPI: they exist primarily so that the application can influence the framework's behaviour.  In these cases there is (usually) no default implementation; it is up to the application to provide an implementation.
