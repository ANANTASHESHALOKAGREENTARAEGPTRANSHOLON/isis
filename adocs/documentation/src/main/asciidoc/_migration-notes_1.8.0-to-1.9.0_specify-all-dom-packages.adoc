Apache Isis automatically scans for certain classes on the classpath in order to configure itself.  Specifically these are:

* searching for classes annotated with xref:rg.adoc#_rg_annotations_manpage-DomainService[`@DomainService`].

* searching for classes extending xref:rg.adoc#_rg_classes_super_manpage-FixtureScript[`FixtureScript`]

* searching for classes annotated with xref:rg.adoc#_rg_annotations_manpage-PersistenceCapable[`@PersistenceCapable`].

Prior to 1.9.0 we used the link:https://github.com/ronmamo/reflections[Reflections] library to do this, which under the covers uses link:http://www.javassist.org/[Javassist].  This is a relatively heavyweight approach.

In 1.9.0 we have changed to using the link:https://github.com/lukehutch/fast-classpath-scanner[Fast-Classpath-Scanner] library, which is altogether more lightweight and has no dependencies.

Generally this change should be transparent, however there are two points to double-check.

== Ensure dom classes registered

First, you should ensure that all domain classes are correctly registered using the `isis.persistor.datanucleus.RegisterEntities.packagePrefix` key.  This should include any domain classes for addon modules.

For example, the (non-ASF) http://github.com/isisaddons/isis-app-todoapp[Isis addons' todoapp]'s configuration now reads:

[source,ini]
----
isis.persistor.datanucleus.RegisterEntities.packagePrefix=\
                todoapp.dom.module,\
                org.isisaddons.module.security.dom,\
                org.isisaddons.module.settings.dom,\
                org.isisaddons.module.sessionlogger.dom,\
                org.isisaddons.module.command.dom,\
                org.isisaddons.module.audit.dom,\
                org.isisaddons.module.publishing.dom
----

[TIP]
====
Alternatively, could have just specified `org.isisaddons.module` instead of enumerating every addon.  This would be a bit slower, but more maintainable.
====

If you fail to do this then DataNucleus will build up its metamodel lazily, rather than validate all classes up-front.  This can call issues: we've seen malformed SQL being submitted when DN wasn't aware of subclasses of a superclass, and we've also seen deadlocks when running against HSQLDB as it attempts to perform a DDL statement intermixed with DML statements.

== Ensure services annotated

In the previous implementation the xref:rg.adoc#_rg_annotations_manpage-DomainService[`@DomainService`] annotation could be applied to a superclass, and would be automatically picked up by any subclasses.

With the new implementation this is no longer the case; every concrete domain service must be annotated with `@DomainService`.
