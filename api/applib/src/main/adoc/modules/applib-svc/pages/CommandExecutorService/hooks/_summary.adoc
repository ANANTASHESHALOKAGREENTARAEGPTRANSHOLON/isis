//<.> whether to switch the effective user for the duration of executing the `Command`.
//Behind the scenes this uses the xref:refguide:applib-svc:SudoService.adoc[`SudoService`].
//<.> provided `Command` must implement `CommandDto`.
//
//When the `Command` is executed, it can also be accessed from the `Interaction` obtained by  xref:refguide:applib-svc:InteractionContext.adoc[`InteractionContext`].
//Any associated objects that implement `HasUniqueId` (audit entries and the like) will therefore have the correct uniqueId and will correctly be associated with the `Command` being executed.
