The `CommandContext` service is a xref:refguide:applib-ant:RequestScoped.adoc[request-scoped] service that reifies the invocation of an action on a domain object into an object itself.
This reified information is encapsulated within the `Command` object.

By default, the `Command` is held in-memory only; once the action invocation has completed, the `Command` object is gone.
The optional supporting xref:refguide:applib-svc:CommandService.adoc[`CommandService`] enables the implementation of `Command` to be pluggable.
With an appropriate implementation
// TODO: v2: update for extensions (eg as provided by the (non-ASF) link:https://platform.incode.org[Incode Platform^]'s command module's xref:refguide:applib-svc:CommandService.adoc[`CommandService`])
the `Command` may then be persisted.

There are two main use cases:

* to allow invocation of ``Command``s to be deferred, for example to be invoked in the background

* to allow ``Command``s to be replicated and replayed to another system (usually for testing or dual-running/migration purposes).

This is normally done using the `CommandWithDto` subtype, that can return a representation of the `Command` as an XML instance of the xref:refguide:schema:cmd.adoc[`cmd.xsd`] schema, which also captures a unique transactionId (GUID) for the command.

Commands are often combined with implementations of the xref:refguide:applib-svc:PublisherService.adoc[`PublisherService`] and sometimes also the xref:refguide:applib-svc:AuditerService.adoc[`AuditerService`]:

* the xref:refguide:applib-svc:PublisherService.adoc[`PublisherService`] publishes interactions as they have  is configured, they provide better traceability as the `Command` is also correlated with any published events, again through the unique `transactionId` GUID
* if a xref:refguide:applib-svc:AuditerService.adoc[`AuditerService`] is configured, they provide better audit information, since the `Command` (the 'cause' of an action) can be correlated to the audit records (the "effect" of the action) through the `transactionId` GUID

In general, though, However, while persistent ``Command``s _can_ be used for these use cases, it is recommended instead to use the xref:refguide:applib-svc:InteractionContext.adoc[`InteractionContext`] service and persistent implementations of the ``Interaction`` object, eg as provided by the (non-ASF) link:https://platform.incode.org[Incode Platform^]'s publishmq module.





//== Screencast

//The link:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqXUZkPB3EI[screencast] provides a run-through of the command (profiling) service, auditing service, publishing service (note: auditing service has since been replaced by `AuditerService`, and publishing service by `PublisherService`).
//It also shows how commands can be run in the background either explicitly by scheduling through the background service or implicitly by way of a framework annotation.

== API

The `CommandContext` request-scoped service defines the following very simple API:

[source,java]
----
@RequestScoped
public class CommandContext {
    @Programmatic
    public Command getCommand() { /* ... */ }
}
----

The `Command` type referenced above is in fact an interface, defined as:

[source,java]
----
public interface Command extends HasUniqueId {

    public abstract String getUser();               // <.>
    public abstract Timestamp getTimestamp();       // <.>

    public abstract Bookmark getTarget();           // <.>
    public abstract String getMemberIdentifier();   // <.>
    public abstract String getTargetClass();        // <.>
    public abstract String getTargetAction();       // <.>
    public String getArguments();                   // <.>
    public String getMemento();                     // <.>

    public ExecuteIn getExecuteIn();                // <.>
    public Executor getExecutor();                  // <.>
    public Persistence getPersistence();            // <.>
    public boolean isPersistHint();                 // <.>

    public abstract Timestamp getStartedAt();       // <.>
    public abstract Timestamp getCompletedAt();     // <.>
    public Command getParent();                     // <.>

    public Bookmark getResult();                    // <.>
    public String getException();                   // <.>

    @Deprecated
    int next(final String sequenceAbbr);            // <.>
}
----
<.> `getUser()` - is the user that initiated the action.
<.> `getTimestamp()` - the date/time at which this action was created.
<.> `getTarget()` - bookmark of the target object (entity or service) on which this action was performed
<.> `getMemberIdentifier()` - holds a string representation of the invoked action
<.> `getTargetClass()` - a human-friendly description of the class of the target object
<.> `getTargetAction()` - a human-friendly name of the action invoked on the target object
<.> `getArguments()` - a human-friendly description of the arguments with which the action was invoked
<.> `getMemento()` - a formal (XML or similar) specification of the action to invoke/being invoked
<.> `getExecuteIn()` - whether this command is executed in the foreground or background
<.> `getExecutor()` - the (current) executor of this command, either user, or background service, or other (eg redirect after post).
<.> `getPersistence()`- the policy controlling whether this command should ultimately be persisted (either "persisted", "if hinted", or "not persisted")
<.> `isPersistHint()` - whether that the command should be persisted, if persistence policy is "if hinted".
<.> `getStartedAt()` - the date/time at which this action started (same as `timestamp` property for foreground commands)
<.> `getCompletedAt()` - the date/time at which this action completed.
<.> `getParent()` - for actions created through the `BackgroundService`, captures the parent action
<.> `getResult()` - bookmark to object returned by action, if any
<.> `getException()` - exception stack trace if action threw exception
<.> No longer used by the framework; see instead
xref:refguide:applib-svc:InteractionContext.adoc[`InteractionContext`] and `Interaction#next()`.


== Implementation

This class (`o.a.i.applib.services.command.CommandContext`) is also the default implementation.


== Usage

The typical way to indicate that an action should be treated as a command is to annotate it with the xref:refguide:applib-ant:Action.adoc#command[`@Action#command()`] annotation.

For example:

[source,java]
----
public class ToDoItem ... {
    @Action(command=CommandReification.ENABLED)
    public ToDoItem completed() { /* ... */ }
}
----


[TIP]
====
As an alternative to annotating every action with `@Action#command()`, alternatively this can be configured as the default using `isis.services.command.actions` configuration property.

See xref:refguide:applib-ant:Action.adoc#command[`@Action#command()`] and xref:refguide:config:configuring-core.adoc[runtime configuration] for further details.
====


//The xref:refguide:applib-ant:Action.adoc#command[`@Action#command()`] annotation can also be used to specify whether the command should be performed in the background, for example:
//
//[source,java]
//----
//public class ToDoItem ... {
//    @Action(commandExecuteIn=CommandExecuteIn.BACKGROUND)
//    public ToDoItem scheduleImplicitly() {
//        completeSlowly(3000);
//        return this;
//    }
//}
//----
//
//When a background command is invoked, the user is returned the command object itself (to provide a handle to the command being invoked).
//
//This requires that an implementation of xref:refguide:applib-svc:CommandService.adoc[`CommandService`] that persists the commands (such as the (non-ASF) link:https://platform.incode.org[Incode Platform^]'s command module's `CommandService`) is configured.
//It also requires that a scheduler is configured to execute the background commands, see xref:refguide:applib-svc:_BackgroundCommandService.adoc[`BackgroundCommandService`]).



== Interacting with the services

Typically domain objects will have little need to interact with the `CommandContext` and `Command` directly; what is more useful is that these are persisted in support of the various use cases identified above.

One case however where a domain object might want to obtain the `Command` is to determine whether it has been invoked in the foreground, or in the background.
It can do this using the `getExecutedIn()` method:

Although not often needed, this then allows the domain object to access the `Command` object through the `CommandContext` service.
To expand the above example:


[source,java]
----
public class ToDoItem ... {
    @Action(
        command=CommandReification.ENABLED,
        commandExecuteIn=CommandExecuteIn.BACKGROUND
    )
    public ToDoItem completed() {
        ...
        Command currentCommand = commandContext.getCommand();
        ...
    }
    @Inject
    CommandContext commandContext;
}
----


If run in the background, it might then notify the user (eg by email) if all work is done.

This leads us onto a related point, distinguishing the current effective user vs the originating "real" user.
When running in the foreground, the current user can be obtained from the xref:refguide:applib-svc:UserService.adoc[`UserService`], using:

[source,java]
----
String user = userService.getUser().getName();
----

If running in the background, however, then the current user will be the credentials of the background process, for example as run by a Quartz scheduler job.

The domain object can still obtain the original ("effective") user that caused the job to be created, using:

[source,java]
----
String user = commandContext.getCommand().getUser();
----





== Related Services

The xref:refguide:applib-svc:CommandContext.adoc[`CommandContext`] service is very similar in nature to the xref:refguide:applib-svc:InteractionContext.adoc[`InteractionContext`], in that the `Command` object accessed through it is very similar to the `Interaction` object obtained from the `InteractionContext`.
The principle distinction is that while `Command` represents the __intention__ to invoke an action or edit a property, the `Interaction` (and contained ``Execution``s) represents the actual execution.

//Most of the time a `Command` will be followed directly by its corresponding `Interaction`.
//However, if the `Command` is annotated to run in the background (using xref:refguide:applib-ant:Action.adoc#command[`@Action#commandExecuteIn()`], or is explicitly created through the xref:refguide:applib-svc:BackgroundService.adoc[`BackgroundService`], then the actual interaction/execution is deferred until some other mechanism invokes the command (eg as described xref:userguide:btb:about.adoc#BackgroundCommandExecution[here]).
//The persistence of background commands requires a configured xref:refguide:applib-svc:_BackgroundCommandService.adoc[`BackgroundCommandService`]) to actually persist such commands for execution.

``Command``s
//- even if executed in the foreground -
can also be persisted by way of the xref:refguide:applib-svc:CommandService.adoc[`CommandService`].
//Implementations of `CommandService` and `BackgroundCommandService` are intended to go together, so that child ``Command``s persistent (to be executed in the background) can be associated with their parent ``Command``s (executed in the foreground, with the background `Command` created explicitly through the xref:refguide:applib-svc:BackgroundService.adoc[`BackgroundService`]).
