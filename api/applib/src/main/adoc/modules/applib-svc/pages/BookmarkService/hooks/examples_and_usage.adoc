== Usage

There are two mixins that will contribute to this interface:

* xref:system:generated:index/applib/services/bookmark/BookmarkHolder_lookup.adoc[BookmarkHolder_lookup]
+
which contributes a `lookup` action to return the referenced object

* xref:system:generated:index/applib/services/bookmark/BookmarkHolder_object.adoc[BookmarkHolder_object]
+
which contributes instead an `object` property, being the referenced object.

Either of these can be suppressed, if required, using a vetoing subscriber that listens to the action or property domain event in order to hide the member.


// TODO: v2 - to fix up links.

//== Examples
//
//For example, a `Customer` object with an xref:refguide:applib-ant:DomainObject.adoc#objectType[object type] of "custmgmt.Customer" and an id of 123
//would correspond to a xref:BookmarkService.adoc#bookmark[`Bookmark`] with a string representation of "custmgmt.Customer|123".
//
//Bookmarks are useful to store a reference to an arbitrary object, although be aware that there is no referential integrity.
//
//Several of the extension libraries use bookmarks.
//For example the xref:refguide:applib-svc:AuditerService.adoc[`AuditerService`] uses bookmarks to identify the object that is being modified.
//
//Serialized form of bookmarks also appear within  xref:refguide:schema:about.adoc[schema] instances, for example as used by xref:refguide:applib-svc:CommandServiceInternal.adoc[`CommandService`] and the xref:refguide:applib-svc:ExecutionSubscriber.adoc[`PublisherService`].
