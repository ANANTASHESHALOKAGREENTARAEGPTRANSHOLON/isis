== Examples

A common use-case is to ignore implementation-level artifacts.
For example:

[source,java]
----
public class Customer implements Comparable<Customer> {
    ...
    @Programmatic
    public int compareTo(Customer c) {
        return getSalary() - c.getSalary();
    }
    ...
}
----

Note that `@Programmatic` is not the same as `@Action(hidden=Where.EVERYWHERE)` or `@Property(hidden=Where.EVERYWHERE)` etc; it actually means that the class member will not be part of the Apache Isis metamodel.
