:page-partial:

The release process consists of:

* the release manager xref:comguide:ROOT:cutting-a-release.adoc[cutting the release]

* members of the Apache Isis PMC xref:comguide:ROOT:verifying-releases.adoc[verifying] and voting on the release

* the release manager performing post-release tasks, for either a successful or an xref:comguide:ROOT:post-release-unsuccessful.adoc[unsuccessful] vote (former documented below)

For a vote to succeed, there must be +3 votes from PMC members, and the vote must have been open at least 72 hours.
If there are not +3 votes after this time then it is perfectly permissible to keep the vote open longer.

This section describes the steps to perform if the vote has been successful.

== Inform dev ML

Post the results to the `dev@isis.a.o` mailing list:

[source,subs="attributes+"]
----
[RESULT] [VOTE] Apache Isis Core release {isisrel}
----

using the body (alter last line as appropriate):

[source]
----
The vote has completed with the following result :

  +1 (binding): ... list of names ...
  +1 (non binding): ... list of names ...

  -1 (binding): ... list of names ...
  -1 (non binding): ... list of names ...

The vote is SUCCESSFUL.

I'll now go ahead and complete the post-release activities.
----

== Release to Maven Central

CAUTION: We release from Maven Central before anything else; we don't want to push the git tags (an irreversible action) until we know that this has worked ok.

From the http://repository.apache.org[ASF Nexus repository], select the staging repository and select 'release' from the top menu.

image::release-process/nexus-release-1.png[width="600px",link="{imagesdir}/release-process/nexus-release-1.png"]

This moves the release artifacts into an Apache releases repository; from there they will be automatically moved to the Maven repository.


== Set environment variables

As we did for the cutting of the release, we set environment variables to parameterize the following steps:

[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
export ISISJIRA=ISIS-9999                           # <.>
export ISISTMP=/c/tmp                               # <.>
export ISISREL={isisrel}                           # <.>
export ISISRC=RC1                                   # <.>
export ISISBRANCH=release-$ISISREL-$ISISRC
export ISISART=isis

env | grep ISIS | sort
----
<.> set to an "umbrella" ticket for all release activities.
(One should exist already, xref:comguide:ROOT:post-release-successful.adoc#create-new-jira[created at] the beginning of the development cycle now completing).
<.> adjust by platform
<.> adjust as required
<.> adjust as necessary if there was more than one attempt to release

Open up a terminal, and switch to the correct release branch:

[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
git checkout $ISISBRANCH
----

== Update tags

Replace the `-RCn` tag with another without the qualifier.

You can do this using the `scripts/promoterctag.sh` script; for example:

[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
sh scripts/promoterctag.sh $ISISART-$ISISREL $ISISRC
----
This script pushes the tag under `refs/tags/rel`.
As per Apache policy (communicated on 10th Jan 2016 to Apache PMCs), this path is 'protected' and is unmodifiable (guaranteeing the provenance that the ASF needs for releases).


== Update JIRA

=== Close tickets

Close all JIRA tickets for the release, or moved to future releases if not yet addressed.
Any tickets that were partially implemented should be closed, and new tickets created for the functionality on the ticket not yet implemented.


=== Generate Release Notes

From the root directory, generate the release notes for the current release, in Asciidoc format; eg:

[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
sh scripts/jira-release-notes.sh ISIS $ISISREL > /tmp/1
----

[NOTE]
====
This script uses 'jq' to parse JSON.
See the script itself for details of how to install this utility.
====

=== Mark the version as released

In JIRA, go to the link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/plugins/servlet/project-config/ISIS/versions[administration section] for the Apache Isis project and update the version as being released.

In the link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=87[Kanban view] this will have the effect of marking all tickets as released (clearing the "done" column).

[#create-new-jira]
=== Create new JIRA

Create a new JIRA ticket as a catch-all for the _next_ release.

== Update Release Notes

In the main `isis` repo (ie containing the asciidoc source):

* Create a new `relnotes.adoc` file to hold the JIRA-generated release notes generated above.
+
This should live in  `antora/components/relnotes/modules/ROOT/pages/yyyy/vvv/relnotes.adoc`

** where `yyyy` is the year
** where `vvv` is the version number

* Update the `nav.adoc` file to reference these release notes
+
In `antora/components/relnotes/ROOT/nav.adoc`

* Update the table in the `about.adoc` summary
+
In `antora/components/relnotes/ROOT/pages/about.adoc`


* update the `doap_isis.rdf` file (which provides a machine-parseable description of the project) with details of the new release.
Validate using the http://www.w3.org/RDF/Validator/[W3C RDF Validator] service.
+
TIP: For more on DOAP files, see these link:http://projects.apache.org/doap.html[Apache policy docs].

* Update the link:https://github.com/apache/isis/blob/master/STATUS[STATUS] file (in root of Apache Isis' source) should be updated with details of the new release.

* commit the changes
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
git add .
git commit -m "$ISISJIRA: updates release notes, STATUS and doap_isis.rdf"
----

== Release Source Zip

As described in the link:http://www.apache.org/dev/release-publishing.html#distribution_dist[Apache documentation], each Apache TLP has a `release/TLP-name` directory in the distribution Subversion repository at link:https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist[https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist].
Once a release vote passes, the release manager should `svn add` the artifacts (plus signature and hash files) into this location.
The release is then automatically pushed to http://www.apache.org/dist/[http://www.apache.org/dist/] by `svnpubsub`.
Only the most recent release of each supported release line should be contained here, old versions should be deleted.

Each project is responsible for the structure of its directory.
The directory structure of Apache Isis reflects the directory structure in our git source code repo:

[source]
----
isis/
  core/
----

If necessary, checkout this directory structure:

[source,bash]
----
svn co https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/isis isis-dist
----

Next, add the new release into the appropriate directory, and delete any previous release.
The `upd.sh` script can be used to automate this:

[source,bash]
----
old_ver=$1
new_ver=$2


# constants
repo_root=https://repository.apache.org/content/repositories/releases/org/apache/isis

zip="source-release.zip"
asc="$zip.asc"
md5="$zip.md5"


#
# isis-core
#
type="core"
fullname="isis-parent"
pushd isis-core

curl -O $repo_root/$type/$fullname/$new_ver/$fullname-$new_ver-$asc
svn add $fullname-$new_ver-$asc
curl -O $repo_root/$type/$fullname/$new_ver/$fullname-$new_ver-$md5
svn add $fullname-$new_ver-$md5
curl -O $repo_root/$type/$fullname/$new_ver/$fullname-$new_ver-$zip
svn add $fullname-$new_ver-$zip

svn delete $fullname-$old_ver-$asc
svn delete $fullname-$old_ver-$md5
svn delete $fullname-$old_ver-$zip

popd

----

[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
sh upd.sh [previous_release] {isisrel}
----

The script downloads the artifacts from the Nexus release repository, adds the artifacts to subversion and deletes the previous version.

Double check that the files are correct; there is sometimes a small delay in the files becoming available in the release repository.
It should be sufficient to check just the `md5` or `.asc` files that these look valid (aren't HTML 404 error pages):

[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
vi `find . -name *.md5`
----

Assuming all is good, commit the changes:

[source,subs="attributes+"]
----
svn commit -m "publishing isis source releases to dist.apache.org"
----

If the files are invalid, then revert using `svn revert . --recursive` and try again in a little while.


== Final website updates

Before we xref:#generate-website[generate the website], we apply final updates:

* If there have been updates to any of the schemas:

** copy the new schema(s) from `api/schema/src/main/resources/o.a.i.s.xxx`
+
to its versioned:
+
`antora/supplemental-ui/schema/xxx/xxx-ver.xsd`

** ensure the non-versioned is same as the highest versioned
+
`antora/supplemental-ui/schema/xxx/xxx.xsd`

* Update the version that appears on the home page of the website, in `antora/supplemental-ui/index.html`
+
[source,html,subs="attributes+"]
----
curl https://codeload.github.com/apache/isis-app-helloworld/zip/{isisrel} | jar xv
cd isis-app-helloworld-{isisrel}
----
+
and
+
[source,html,subs="attributes+"]
----
curl https://codeload.github.com/apache/isis-app-simpleapp/zip/{isisrel} | jar xv
cd isis-app-simpleapp-{isisrel}
----

* Commit the changes:
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
git add .
git commit -m "$ISISJIRA: bumps index.html version to $ISISREL, also schema updates"
----



[#generate-website]
== Generate website

We use Antora to generate the site, not only the latest version but also any previous versions listed in `site.yml`.
The most recently version being released is built in effect twice, as both "latest" and with its formal tag name.

As a slight complication, the tags created previously on the release branch (`refs/tags/rel/xxx`) can't be used for this purpose, because the `antora.yml` files specify a branch name of simply "latest".
We therefore temporarily modify all of the `antora.yml` files and `site.yml` with a reference to a new tag, and then change them back afterwards:

* If there have been any changes from other branches (eg fixes to documentation in non-release branches) then merge them into the release branch.

* Update all `antora.yml` files, eg using an IDE:
+
** `version: latest` -> `version: {isisrel}`
+
image::release-process-post/update-antora-latest.png[width="800px",link="{imagesdir}/release-process-post/update-antora-latest.png"]

* Commit the changes:
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
git add .
git commit -m "$ISISJIRA: bumps antora.yml to $ISISREL"
----

* Now tag
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
git tag docs/$ISISART-$ISISREL
git push origin refs/tags/docs/$ISISART-$ISISREL:refs/tags/docs/$ISISART-$ISISREL
----

* Now, immediately the change to `antora.yml` files back again:

** `version: {isisrel}` -> `version: latest`

* Commit these changes, and push the release branch:
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
git add .
git commit -m "$ISISJIRA: reverts antora.yml version to latest"

git push
----

* Now we update `site.yml` (in `antora/playbooks`).
This will reference the tag and also the current branch (for "latest").
Every content source needs to be updated:
+
For example, we change:
+
.site.yml
[source,yml,subs="attributes+"]
----
- url: .
  start_path: antora/components/docs # docs
  branches: HEAD
----
+
to:
+
.site.yml
[source,yml,subs="attributes+"]
----
- url: .
  start_path: antora/components/docs # docs
  tags: docs/isis-{isisrel}                    # <.>
  branches: HEAD                                  # <.>
----
<.> will generate the {isisrel} version
<.> will generate the 'latest' version
+
eg using the IDE:
+
image::release-process-post/update-site-yml-tags.png[width="800px",link="{imagesdir}/release-process-post/update-site-yml-tags.png"]

* commit this change, too (there's no need to push):
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
git add .
git commit -m "$ISISJIRA: adds tag to site.yml"
----

* We are now in a position to actually generate the Antora website:
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
sh preview.sh
----
+
This will write to `antora/target/site`; we'll use the results in the xref:#publish-website[next section].

* Finally, revert the changes to `site.yml` back into "author mode".
+
That is, comment out the tags entries:
+
.site.yml
[source,yml,subs="attributes+"]
----
- url: .
  start_path: antora/components/docs # docs
#  tags: docs/isis-{isisrel}
  branches: HEAD
----
+
eg using the IDE:
+
image::release-process-post/update-site-yml-no-tags.png[width="800px",link="{imagesdir}/release-process-post/update-site-yml-no-tags.png"]

* commit this change, too (there's no need to push):
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
git add .
git commit -m "$ISISJIRA: site.yml back to author mode"
----

[#publish-website]
== Publish website

We now copy the results of the Antora website generation over to the `isis-site` repo:

* in the `isis-site` repo, check out the `asf-site` branch:
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
cd ../isis-site

git checkout asf-site
git pull --ff-only
----

* still in the `isis-site` repo, delete all the files in `content/` _except_ for the `schema` and `versions` directories:
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
pushd content
for a in $(ls -1 | grep -v schema | grep -v versions)
do
    rm -rf $a
done
popd
----

* Copy the generated Antora site to `isis-site` repo's `contents` directory:
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
cd ../isis

cp -Rf antora/target/site/* ../isis-site/content/.
----

* Back in the `isis-site` repo, commit the changes and preview:
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
cd ../isis-site

git add .
git commit -m "$ISISJIRA : production changes to website"

sh preview.sh
----

* If everything looks ok, then push the changes to make live, and switch back to the `isis` repo:
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
git push origin asf-site

cd ../isis
----


== Merge in release branch

Because we release from a branch, the changes made in the branch should be merged back from the release branch back into the `master` branch.

In the `isis` repo:

[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
git checkout master                              # update master with latest
git pull
git merge release-{isisrel}-RC1                  # merge branch onto master
git push origin --delete release-{isisrel}-RC1   # remote branch no longer needed
git branch -d release-{isisrel}-RC1              # branch no longer needed
----


== Bump \{isisrel} in `site.yml`

In `site.yml` file, bump the version of `\{isisrel}`, and commit.


== Update the ASF Reporter website

Log the new release in the link:https://reporter.apache.org/addrelease.html?isis[ASF Reporter website].


== Announce the release

Announce the release to link:mailto:users@isis.apache.org[users mailing list].

For example, for a release of Apache Isis Core, use the following subject:

[source,subs="attributes+"]
----
[ANN] Apache Isis version {isisrel} Released
----

And use the following body (summarizing the main points as required):

[source,subs="attributes+"]
----
The Apache Isis team is pleased to announce the release of Apache Isis {isisrel}.

New features in this release include:

* ...

Full release notes are available on the Apache Isis website at [1].

You can access this release directly from the Maven central repo [2].
Alternatively, download the release and build it from source [3].

Enjoy!

--The Apache Isis team

[1] http://isis.apache.org/relnotes/latest/about.html
[2] http://search.maven.org
[3] http://isis.apache.org/downloads.html
----

== Blog post

link:https://blogs.apache.org/roller-ui/login.rol[Log onto] the http://blogs.apache.org/isis/[Apache blog] and create a new post.
Copy-n-paste the above mailing list announcement should suffice.


== Update dependencies

With the release complete, now is a good time to bump versions of dependencies (so that there is a full release cycle to identify any possible issues).

You will probably want to create a new JIRA ticket for these updates (or if minor then use the "catch-all" JIRA ticket raised earlier for the next release).

=== Merge in any changes from `org.apache:apache`

Check (via link:http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Cg%3A%22org.apache%22%20a%3A%22apache%22[search.maven.org]) whether there is a newer version of the Apache parent `org.apache:apache`.

If there are, merge in these changes to the `core-parent` POM.

=== Update plugin versions

The `maven-versions-plugin` should be used to determine if there are newer versions of any of the plugins used to build Apache Isis.
Since this goes off to the internet, it may take a minute or two to run:

[source,bash]
----
mvn versions:display-plugin-updates > /tmp/foo
grep "\->" /tmp/foo | /bin/sort -u
----

Review the generated output and make updates as you see fit.
(However, if updating, please check by searching for known issues with newer versions).

=== Update dependency versions

The `maven-versions-plugin` should be used to determine if there are newer versions of any of Isis' dependencies.
Since this goes off to the internet, it may take a minute or two to run:

[source,bash]
----
mvn versions:display-dependency-updates > /tmp/foo
grep "\->" /tmp/foo | /bin/sort -u
----

Update any of the dependencies that are out-of-date.
That said, do note that some dependencies may show up with a new dependency, when in fact the dependency is for an old, badly named version.
Also, there may be new dependencies that you do not wish to move to, eg release candidates or milestones.

For example, here is a report showing both of these cases:

[source,bash]
----
[INFO]   asm:asm ..................................... 3.3.1 -> 20041228.180559
[INFO]   commons-httpclient:commons-httpclient .......... 3.1 -> 3.1-jbossorg-1
[INFO]   commons-logging:commons-logging ......... 1.1.1 -> 99.0-does-not-exist
[INFO]   dom4j:dom4j ................................. 1.6.1 -> 20040902.021138
[INFO]   org.datanucleus:datanucleus-api-jdo ................ 3.1.2 -> 3.2.0-m1
[INFO]   org.datanucleus:datanucleus-core ................... 3.1.2 -> 3.2.0-m1
[INFO]   org.datanucleus:datanucleus-jodatime ............... 3.1.1 -> 3.2.0-m1
[INFO]   org.datanucleus:datanucleus-rdbms .................. 3.1.2 -> 3.2.0-m1
[INFO]   org.easymock:easymock ................................... 2.5.2 -> 3.1
[INFO]   org.jboss.resteasy:resteasy-jaxrs ............. 2.3.1.GA -> 3.0-beta-1
----

For these artifacts you will need to search http://search.maven.org[Maven central repo] directly yourself to confirm there are no newer dependencies not shown in this list.
