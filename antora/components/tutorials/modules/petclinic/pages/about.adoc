This tutorial is an introduction to https://isis.apache.org[Apache Isis], and develops a variant of the venerable "pet clinic" demo app.

Each exercise has complete instructions to complete, and/or you can pull down the solutions from the companion github repo:

[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/apache/isis-app-demo
----

In the menu (on the left) you'll see that certain steps have a hand symbol and a number.
These correspond to tags in the git repo, so you can pick up the tutorial wherever you wish.
