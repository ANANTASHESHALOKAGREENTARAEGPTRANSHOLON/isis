From this link:http://isis.markmail.org/thread/g6amfj2eyf2xfjbr[thread] on the Apache Isis users mailing list:

* _my fixtures have grown into a couple of files the application needs to read in when it starts the first time (and possibly later on when the files content change).
What is the right way to do this?
Hook up into the webapp start?
Use events?_


The standard approach is to use xref:fixtures:ROOT:about.adoc[fixture scripts].
These can be run in on start-up for example using the `@PostConstruct` of a seed domain service.

The xref:subdomains:excel:about.adoc[Excel subdomain] library also provides `ExcelFixture`, which is an implementation of `FixtureScript`; it works by providing an implementation of  `ExcelFixtureRowHandler`, to handle each row.
