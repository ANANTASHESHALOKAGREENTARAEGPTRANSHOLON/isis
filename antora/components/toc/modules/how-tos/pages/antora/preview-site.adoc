= Preview site
ifndef::env-site,env-github[]
include::_attributes.adoc[]
endif::[]

To preview the site, just use:

[source,powershell]
----
Build-Docs -Preview
----

This will generate the site (into `target\site` folder) and then use the `serve` Node server to serve up those pages on http://localhost:5000[].

TIP: As an added convenience, this URL is copied to your clipboard, so you can simply alt-tab to your browser and paste in the URL.

If you prefer to use `git bash`, then this script is very similar:

[source,bash]
----
sh preview.sh
----
