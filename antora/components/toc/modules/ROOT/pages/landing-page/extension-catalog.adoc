The framework bundles a number of extensions.
Some are incorporated or referenced by other guides (most notably the xref:testing:ROOT:about.adoc[testing] guide, xref:security:ROOT:about.adoc[security] guide, and the xref:vw:ROOT:about.adoc[wicket viewer] guide).

The remainder can be found in the:

* xref:extensions:ROOT:about.adoc[Extensions Catalog].

There are two further catalogs:

* xref:incubator:ROOT:about.adoc[Incubator Catalog]
+
Extensions that are experimental or unstable, but which may end up graduating to the extensions catalog

* xref:legacy:ROOT:about.adoc[Legacy Catalog]
+
Functionality that has been deprecated or has become defunct, and which is likely to be removed in future versions.
