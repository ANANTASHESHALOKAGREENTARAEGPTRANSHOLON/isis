To get started with a new application, use one of the two git repos on Github that provide a starter app.

== HelloWorld

The helloworld app is  very minimal app, intended just as a starting point to learn what the framework is all about.

include::starters:helloworld:page$script.adoc[]


Notes:

* more on the structure of the Hello World app can be found xref:starters:helloworld:about.adoc[here]
* the source code can be found in this link:https://github.com/apache/isis-app-helloworld[git repo]



== Simple App

This app has the same functionality as _HelloWorld_, but is structured so it can be used as a starting point for developing your own applications.

include::starters:simpleapp:page$script.adoc[]

It also includes some xref:testing:integtestsupport:about.adoc[integration tests], xref:testing:fixtures:about.adoc[fixtures], and xref:testing:specsupport[BDD (Cucumber)] specs.

Notes:

* more on the structure of the Simple App app can be found xref:starters:simpleapp:about.adoc[here]
* the source code can be found in this link:https://github.com/apache/isis-app-simpleapp[git repo]


== Updating to Newer Versions

For both apps you can bump to newer versions of the framework just by updating the `<version>` of the `<parent>`:

[source,bash]
.pom.xml
----
<parent>
    <groupId>org.apache.isis.app</groupId>
    <artifactId>isis-app-starter-parent</artifactId>
    <version>2.0.0</version>  <!--1-->
</parent>
----
<1> update as required.
