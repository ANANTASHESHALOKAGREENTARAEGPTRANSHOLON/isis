=== Names

The xref:system:generated:index/applib/annotation/ActionLayout.adoc#named[named()] element explicitly specifies the action's name, overriding the name that would normally be inferred from the Java source code.

[TIP]
====
Only use this attribute when the desired name cannot be used in Java source code.
Examples of that include a name that would be a reserved Java keyword (eg "package"), or a name that has punctuation, eg apostrophes.
====

For example:

[source,java]
----
public class Customer {
    @ActionLayout(named="Get credit rating")        // <.>
    public CreditRating obtainCreditRating() {
        // ...
    }
}
----

<.> "get" normally indicates a property rather than an action.

As an alternative to using the annotation, the dynamic xref:userguide:fun:ui.adoc#object-layout[file-based layout] can be used instead.

The framework also provides a separate, powerful mechanism for xref:userguide:btb:i18n.adoc[internationalization].
