=== Collection type

The `typeOf` attribute specifies the expected type of an element contained within a collection when for whatever reason the type cannot be inferred from the generic type, or to provide a hint about the actual run-time (as opposed to compile-time) type.

For example:

[source,java]
----
import lombok.Getter;

public void Customer {

    @Collection(typeOf=Order.class)
    @Getter
    private SortedSet outstandingOrders = ...

}
----

[TIP]
====
In general we recommend that you use generics instead, eg `SortedSet<Order>`.
