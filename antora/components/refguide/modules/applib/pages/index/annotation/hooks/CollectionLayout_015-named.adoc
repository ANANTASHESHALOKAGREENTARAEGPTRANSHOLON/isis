=== Names

The xref:system:generated:index/applib/annotation/CollectionLayout.adoc#named[named()] element explicitly specifies the collection's name, overriding the name that would normally be inferred from the Java source code.

[TIP]
====
We recommend that you only use this attribute when the desired name cannot be used in Java source code.
Examples of that include a name that would be a reserved Java keyword (eg "package"), or a name that has punctuation, eg apostrophes.
====

By default the name is HTML escaped.
To allow HTML markup, set the related xref:system:generated:index/applib/annotation/CollectionLayout.adoc#namedEscaped[namedEscaped()] element to `false`.

For example:

[source,java]
----
import lombok.Getter;
import lombok.Setter;

public class ToDoItem {
    @CollectionLayout(
        named="Todo items that are <i>dependencies</i> of this item",
        namedEscaped=false
    )
    @Getter @Setter
    private SortedSet<ToDoItem> dependencies = ...

}
----


As an alternative to using the annotation, the dynamic xref:userguide:fun:ui.adoc#object-layout[file-based layout] can be used instead.

The framework also provides a separate, powerful mechanism for xref:userguide:btb:i18n.adoc[internationalization].
