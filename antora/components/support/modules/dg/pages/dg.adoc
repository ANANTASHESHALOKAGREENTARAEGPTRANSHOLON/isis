== Developers' Guide

This developers' guide is for:

* programmers who want to just use Apache Isis to build applications, and want help setting up their development
environment or to build their code from the command line (eg to execute within a continuous integration server such
as Jenkins)

* programmers who want to contribute back patches (bug fixes, new features) either to the codebase or the framework's documentation

* committers of Apache Isis itself who want guidance on release process, publishing documents and other related procedures.
