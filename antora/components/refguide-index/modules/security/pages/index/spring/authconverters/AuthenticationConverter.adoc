Defines an SPI to attempt to convert a Spring _Authentication_ into an Apache Isis xref:refguide:applib:index/services/user/UserMemento.adoc[UserMemento] .

The _Authentication_ will have already been verified as having been _Authentication#isAuthenticated() authenticated_ .

Implementations should be defined as Spring _org.springframework.stereotype.Component_ s and added to the _org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration application context_ either by being _org.springframework.context.annotation.Import imported_ explicitly or implicitly through _org.springframework.context.annotation.ComponentScan_ .

All known converters are checked one by one, but checking stops once one converter has successively converted the _Authentication_ into a xref:refguide:applib:index/services/user/UserMemento.adoc[UserMemento] (in other words, chain-of-responsibility pattern). Use the _org.springframework.core.Ordered_ to influence the order in which converter implementations are checked.
