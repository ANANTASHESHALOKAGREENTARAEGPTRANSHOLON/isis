WARNING: Not released yet.

== Removal of Image Value Type

Some Java classes and/or packages have been renamed/moved:

[source,java]
.Applib
----
// org.apache.isis.applib.value.Image
org.apache.isis.legacy.applib.value.Image // <.>
----
<.> only kept to ease migration, use `java.awt.image.BufferedImage` instead, which is supported by the framework as value type


== Removal of deprecated Contributees

.Config
[source,java]
----
isis.core.metaModel.validator.serviceActionsOnly=true // <.>
isis.core.metaModel.validator.mixins-only=true        // <.>
----
<.> `@DomainService(natureOfService=VIEW/REST)` is now solely used for UI menu action providers and REST end-points.
There is no longer the need to validate uses of `natureOfService=DOMAIN` as this option was removed.  
<.> Support for services that contribute members to other `DomainObjects` was removed. Use `Mixins` instead. 

See the former java-doc for hints on how to migrate the previous options.

.@DomainService(natureOfService=...)
[source,java]
----
/**
 * A <em>programmatic</em> service.
 * <p>
 * The service's actions do not appear on any viewer and are not visible in the REST API. In other words
 * these are not contributed to the domain-model. However, the service is injectable into domain objects.
 * </p>
 *
 * @deprecated will be removed with 2.0.0 release! use Spring's {@link org.springframework.stereotype.Service @Service} instead;
 * @apiNote For now, used as synonym for {@link #REST}
 */
@Deprecated
DOMAIN,

/**
 * @deprecated will be removed with 2.0.0 release! use {@link #REST} instead;
 * @apiNote For now, used as synonym for {@link #REST}
 */
@Deprecated
VIEW_REST_ONLY,

/**
 * @deprecated will be removed with 2.0.0 release! use {@link #VIEW} instead
 * @apiNote For now, used as synonym for {@link #VIEW}
 */
@Deprecated
VIEW_MENU_ONLY,

/**
 * @deprecated will be removed with 2.0.0 release!
 * <p>
 * For now, contributing actions will be gathered to show up in the 'others' menu to ease migration.
 * These will likely not work.
 * <p>
 * Migration Note: For each {@code Action} write a new mixin class.
 * see {@link Mixin}
 * @apiNote For now, used as synonym for {@link #VIEW}
