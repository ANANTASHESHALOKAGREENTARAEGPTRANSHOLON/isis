= FactoryService : _interface_





* `[teal]#*getOrCreate*#<T>(Class<T> requiredType)` : `T`
+
General purpose factory method, to automatically get or create an instance of _requiredType_ .
+
Maps onto one of the specialized factory methods _#get(Class)_ or _#create(Class)_ based on the type's meta-data.


* `[teal]#*get*#<T>(Class<T> requiredType)` : `T`
+
Gets an instance (possibly shared or independent) of the specified _requiredType_ , with injection points resolved and any life-cycle callback processed.


* `[teal]#*detachedEntity*#<T>(Class<T> domainClass)` : `T`
+
Creates a new detached entity instance, with injection points resolved and defaults applied.


* `[teal]#*detachedEntity*#<T>(T entity)` : `T`
+
Creates a new detached entity instance, with injection points resolved.


* `[teal]#*mixin*#<T>(Class<T> mixinClass, Object mixedIn)` : `T`
+
Creates a new Mixin instance, with injection points resolved.


* `[teal]#*viewModel*#<T>(Class<T> viewModelClass, String mementoStr)` : `T`
+
Creates a new ViewModel instance, with injection points resolved, and initialized according to the given _mementoStr_


* `[teal]#*viewModel*#<T>(Class<T> viewModelClass)` : `T`
+
Creates a new ViewModel instance, with injection points resolved and defaults applied.


* `[teal]#*viewModel*#<T>(T viewModel)` : `T`
+
Resolves injection points for given ViewModel instance.


* `[teal]#*create*#<T>(Class<T> domainClass)` : `T`
+
Creates a new instance of the specified class, with injection points resolved and defaults applied.


* `[line-through gray]#*instantiate*#<T>(Class<T> domainClass)` : `T`
+
Creates a new instance of the specified class, but does not persist it.
+
It is recommended that the object be initially instantiated using this method, though the framework will also handle the case when the object is simply _new()_ ed up. The benefits of using _#instantiate(Class)_ are:
+
** any services will be injected into the object immediately (otherwise they will not be injected until the framework becomes aware of the object, typically when it is _RepositoryService#persist(Object) persist_ ed
+
** the default value for any properties (usually as specified by `default _Xxx_ ()` supporting methods) will (since 2.0) be used
+
** the `created()` callback will not be called.
+
The corollary is: if your code never uses `default _Xxx_ ()` supporting methods or the `created()` callback, then you can alternatively just _new()_ up the object rather than call this method.
+
[red]#_deprecated:_#
+
with semantic changes since 2.0 previous behavior is no longer guaranteed, instead consider use of @ _#detachedEntity(Class)_ or _#getOrCreate(Class)_ if applicable
