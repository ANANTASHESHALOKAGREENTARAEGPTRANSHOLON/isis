= FactoryService : _interface_







* `*instantiate*(Class<T> domainClass)` : `T`
+
Creates a new instance of the specified class, but does not persist it.



It is recommended that the object be initially instantiated using
this method, though the framework will also handle the case when
the object is simply <i>new()</i>ed up.  The benefits of using
 _#instantiate(Class)_  are:


<ul>
<li>any services will be injected into the object immediately
    (otherwise they will not be injected until the framework
    becomes aware of the object, typically when it is
     _RepositoryService#persist(Object) persist_ ed</li>
<li>the default value for any properties (usually as specified by
    <tt>default<i>Xxx</i>()</tt> supporting methods) will (since 2.0) be
    used</li>
<li>the <tt>created()</tt> callback will not be called.
</ul>



The corollary is: if your code never uses <tt>default<i>Xxx</i>()</tt>
supporting methods or the <tt>created()</tt> callback, then you can
alternatively just <i>new()</i> up the object rather than call this
method.
