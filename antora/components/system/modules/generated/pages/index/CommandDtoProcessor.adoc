= CommandDtoProcessor : _interface_



Refine (or possibly ignore) a command when replicating from primary to secondary.

* `[teal]#*process*#(CommandDto commandDto)` : `CommandDto`
+
The implementation can if necessary refine or alter the _CommandDto_ to be replicated from primary to secondary.
+
That said, the most common use case is to returnnull, which results in the command effectively being ignore.
