+
--
When called within an existing transactional boundary returns the unique identifier to the transaction, _null_ otherwise.
--
<.> `[teal]#*currentTransactionState*#()` : `xref:system:generated:index/applib/services/xactn/TransactionState.adoc[TransactionState]`
<.> `[teal]#*flushTransaction*#()` : `void`
+
--
Flush all changes to the object store.

Occasionally useful to ensure that newly persisted domain objects are flushed to the database prior to a subsequent repository query.
--
<.> `[teal]#*nextTransaction*#()` : `void`
+
--
Commits the current transaction (if there is one), and begins a new one. If there is no current transaction, then is a no-op.
--
<.> `[teal]#*executeWithinTransaction*#<T>(Callable<T> callable)` : `xref:system:generated:index/commons/functional/Result.adoc[Result]<T>`
+
--
Runs given _callable_ within an existing transactional boundary, or in the absence of such a boundary creates a new one.
--
<.> `[teal]#*executeWithinTransaction*#(ThrowingRunnable runnable)` : `Optional<Throwable>`
+
--
Runs given _runnable_ within an existing transactional boundary, or in the absence of such a boundary creates a new one.
