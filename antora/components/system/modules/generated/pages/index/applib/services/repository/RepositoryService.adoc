== Members

[#getEntityState]
=== getEntityState

Returns the EntityState of given _object_ . Returns _EntityState#NOT_PERSISTABLE_ for _object==null_ .

[#detachedEntity]
=== detachedEntity

Same as _org.apache.isis.applib.services.factory.FactoryService#detachedEntity(Object)_ ; provided as a convenience because instantiating and _#persist(Object) persisting_ are often done together.

[#persist]
=== persist

Persist the specified object (or do nothing if already persistent).

[#persistAndFlush]
=== persistAndFlush

Persist the specified object (or do nothing if already persistent) and flushes changes to the database.

[#remove]
=== remove

Deletes the domain object but only if is attached.

[#removeAndFlush]
=== removeAndFlush

Deletes the domain object but only if is persistent, and flushes changes to the database.

[#removeAll]
=== removeAll

Removes all instances of the domain object.

Intended primarily for testing purposes.

[#allInstances]
=== allInstances

As _#allInstances(Class, long, long)_ , but but returning all instances rather than just those * within the specified range..

[#allInstances]
=== allInstances

Returns all the instances of the specified type (including subtypes). If the optional range parameters are used, the dataset returned starts from (0 based) index, and consists of only up to count items.

If there are no instances the list will be empty. This method creates a new _List_ object each time it is called so the caller is free to use or modify the returned _List_ , but the changes will not be reflected back to the repository.

This method should only be called where the number of instances is known to be relatively low, unless the optional range parameters (2 longs) are specified. The range parameters are "start" and "count".

[#allMatches]
=== allMatches

As _#allMatches(Class, Predicate, long, long)_ , but returning all instances rather than just those within the specified range.

[#allMatches]
=== allMatches

Returns all the instances of the specified type (including subtypes) that the predicate object accepts. If the optional range parameters are used, the dataset returned starts from (0 based) index, and consists of only up to count items.

If there are no instances the list will be empty. This method creates a new _List_ object each time it is called so the caller is free to use or modify the returned _List_ , but the changes will not be reflected back to the repository.

This method is useful during exploration/prototyping, but - because the filtering is performed client-side - this method is only really suitable for initial development/prototyping, or for classes with very few instances. Use _#allMatches(Query)_ for production code.

[#allMatches]
=== allMatches

Returns all the instances that match the given xref:system:generated:index/applib/query/Query.adoc[Query] .

If there are no instances the list will be empty. This method creates a new _List_ object each time it is called so the caller is free to use or modify the returned _List_ , but the changes will not be reflected back to the repository.

This method is the recommended way of querying for multiple instances.

[#uniqueMatch]
=== uniqueMatch

Find the only instance of the specified type (including subtypes) that has the specified title.

If no instance is found then _Optional#empty()_ will be return, while if there is more that one instances a run-time exception will be thrown.

This method is useful during exploration/prototyping, but - because the filtering is performed client-side - this method is only really suitable for initial development/prototyping, or for classes with very few instances. Use _#uniqueMatch(Query)_ for production code.

[#uniqueMatch]
=== uniqueMatch

Find the only instance that matches the provided query.

If no instance is found then _Optional#empty()_ will be return, while if there is more that one instances a run-time exception will be thrown.

This method is the recommended way of querying for (precisely) one instance. See also _#allMatches(Query)_

[#firstMatch]
=== firstMatch

Find the only instance of the specified type (including subtypes) that has the specified title.

If no instance is found then _Optional#empty()_ will be return, while if there is more that one instances then the first will be returned.

This method is useful during exploration/prototyping, but - because the filtering is performed client-side - this method is only really suitable for initial development/prototyping, or for classes with very few instances. Use _#firstMatch(Query)_ for production code.

[#firstMatch]
=== firstMatch

Find the only instance that matches the provided query, if any..

If no instance is found then _Optional#empty()_ will be return, while if there is more that one instances then the first will be returned.

[#refresh]
=== refresh

Reloads the pojo.

[#detach]
=== detach

Detach the entity from the current persistence session.

This allows the entity to be read from even after the PersistenceSession that obtained it has been closed.

[#detachedEntity]
=== detachedEntity

[WARNING]
====
[red]#_deprecated:_#

if applicable use _#detachedEntity(Object)_ instead ... "new is the new new", passing in a new-ed up instance is more flexible and also more error prone, eg. it allows the compiler to check validity of the used constructor rather than doing construction reflective at runtime.

[#instantiate]
=== instantiate

[WARNING]
====
[red]#_deprecated:_#

if applicable use _#detachedEntity(Object)_ instead
====

[#isPersistent]
=== isPersistent

[WARNING]
====
[red]#_deprecated:_#

due to ambiguous semantic, use _#getEntityState(Object)_ instead
====

Determines if the specified object is persistent (that it is stored permanently outside of the virtual machine in the object store).

This method can also return `true` if the object has been _#isDeleted(Object) deleted_ from the object store.

[#isDeleted]
=== isDeleted

[WARNING]
====
[red]#_deprecated:_#

due to ambiguous semantic, use _#getEntityState(Object)_ instead
====

Determines if the specified object has been deleted from the object store.
