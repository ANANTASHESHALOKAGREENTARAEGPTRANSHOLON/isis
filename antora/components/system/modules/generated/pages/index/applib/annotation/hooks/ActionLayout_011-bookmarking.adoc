=== Bookmarking

The xref:system:generated:index/applib/annotation/ActionLayout.adoc#bookmarking[bookmarking()] element indicates if an action (with safe xref:system:generated:index/applib/annotation/Action.adoc#semantics[action semantics]) is automatically bookmarked.

In the xref:vw:ROOT:about.adoc[Wicket viewer], a link to a bookmarked object is shown in the bookmarks panel.

[TIP]
====
The xref:vw:ROOT:about.adoc[Wicket viewer] supports `alt-[` as a shortcut for opening the bookmark panel.  `Esc` will close.
====


For example:

[source,java]
----
public class ToDoItems {
    @Action(semantics=SemanticsOf.SAFE)
    @ActionLayout(bookmarking=BookmarkPolicy.AS_ROOT)
    @MemberOrder(sequence = "1")
    public List<ToDoItem> notYetComplete() {
        ...
    }
}
----

indicates that the `notYetComplete()` action is bookmarkable.



[NOTE]
====
The enum value `AS_CHILD` has no meaning for actions; it relates only to bookmarked xref:system:generated:index/applib/annotation/DomainObjectLayout.adoc#bookmarking[domain object]s.
====


As an alternative to using the annotation, the dynamic xref:userguide:fun:ui.adoc#object-layout[file-based layout] can be used instead.
