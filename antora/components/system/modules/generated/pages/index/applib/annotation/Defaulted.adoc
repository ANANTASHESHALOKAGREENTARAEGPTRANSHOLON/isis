Indicates that the class should have a default, by providing a link to a xref:applib/adapters/DefaultsProvider[DefaultsProvider] , or some externally-configured mechanism.

This possibly seems a little tortuous. The more obvious means to provide a default would seem to be a simple `@DefaultsTo(new SomeObject())` . However, Java only allows primitives, strings and class literals to be used in annotations. We therefore need delegate to an external implementation. (This more complex design is also more flexible of course; the implementation of xref:applib/adapters/DefaultsProvider[DefaultsProvider] could adjust the default it provides according to circumstance, for example).

.Java Sources
[source,java]
----
@interface Defaulted {

  String defaultsProviderName() default ""; // <.>

  Class<?> defaultsProviderClass() default Defaulted.class; // <.>
}
----

<.> `[teal]#*_defaultsProviderName_*#` : `String`
+
--
The fully qualified name of a class that implements the xref:applib/adapters/DefaultsProvider[DefaultsProvider] interface.

This is optional because some implementations may pick up the defaults provider via a configuration file, or via the equivalent _#defaultsProviderClass()_ .

Implementation note: the default value provided here is simply an empty string because `null` is not a valid default.
--
<.> `[teal]#*_defaultsProviderClass_*#` : `Class<?>`
+
--
As per _#defaultsProviderName()_ , but specifying a class literal rather than a fully qualified class name.

Implementation note: the default value provided here is simply the xref:applib/annotation/Defaulted[Defaulted] 's own class, because `null` is not a valid default.
