= MetaModelService : _interface_



This service provides a formal API into Isis' metamodel.
This API is currently extremely limited, but the intention is to extend it gradually as use cases emerge.

* `[teal]#*fromObjectType*#(String objectType)` : `Class<?>`
+
Provides a reverse lookup of a domain class' object type, as defined by _DomainObject#objectType()_ (or any other mechanism that corresponds to Isis'ObjectSpecIdFacet).


* `[teal]#*toObjectType*#(Class<?> domainType)` : `String`
+
Provides a lookup of a domain class' object type, as defined by _DomainObject#objectType()_ (or any other mechanism that corresponds to Isis'ObjectSpecIdFacet).


* `[teal]#*getDomainModel*#()` : `xref:system:generated:index/DomainModel.adoc[DomainModel]`
+
Returns a list of representations of each of member of each domain class.
+
Used by xref:system:generated:index/MetaModelServiceMenu.adoc[MetaModelServiceMenu] to return a downloadable CSV.
+
Note that _MetaModelService#exportMetaModel(Config)_ provides a superset of the functionality provided by this method.
