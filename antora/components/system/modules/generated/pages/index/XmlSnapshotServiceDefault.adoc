= XmlSnapshotServiceDefault : _class_



This service allows an XML document to be generated capturing the data of a root entity and specified related entities. This XML can be used for various purposes, such as mail merge/reporting, or adhoc auditing.
This implementation has no UI and there are no other implementations of the service API, and so it annotated with _org.apache.isis.applib.annotation.DomainService_ . Because this class is implemented in core, this means that it is automatically registered and available for use; no further configuration is required.

* `[teal]#*builderFor*#(Object domainObject)` : `Builder`
