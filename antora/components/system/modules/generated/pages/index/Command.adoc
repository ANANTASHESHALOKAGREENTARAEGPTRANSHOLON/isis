= Command : _class_



Represents the _intention to_ invoke either an action or modify a property. There can be only one such intention per (web) request, so a command is in effect interaction-scoped.
Each Command holds a _CommandDto_ (see Apache Isiscmdschema) which reifies all the details in a serializable form.
It also captures details of the corresponding action invocation (or property edit), specifically when that action/edit _Command#getStartedAt() started_ or _Command#getCompletedAt() completed_ , and its result, either a _Command#getResult() return value_ or an _Command#getException() exception_ . Also captures a stack of _ActionDomainEvent_ s.
Note that when invoking an action, other actions may be invoked courtesy of the xref:system:generated:index/WrapperFactory.adoc[WrapperFactory] . These "sub-actions" do _not_ modify the contents of the current command object; in other words think of the command object as representing the outer-most originating action.
That said, if the sub-action is invoked asynchronously (using _WrapperFactory#asyncWrap(Object, AsyncControl)_ or _WrapperFactory#asyncWrapMixin(Class, Object, AsyncControl)_ ), then a separate xref:system:generated:index/Command.adoc[Command] object is created, and the originating xref:system:generated:index/Command.adoc[Command] is set to be its _Command#getParent() parent_ .

* `[teal]#*getUsername*#()` : `String`
+
The user that created the command.
+
Derived from _#getCommandDto()_ 's _CommandDto#getUser()_


* `[teal]#*getTimestamp*#()` : `Timestamp`
+
The date/time at which this command was created.
+
Derived from _#getCommandDto()_ 's _CommandDto#getTimestamp()_ .


* `[teal]#*getTarget*#()` : `xref:system:generated:index/Bookmark.adoc[Bookmark]`
+
Derived from _#getCommandDto()_ , is the xref:system:generated:index/Bookmark.adoc[Bookmark] of the target object (entity or service) on which this action/edit was performed.


* `[teal]#*getLogicalMemberIdentifier*#()` : `String`
+
Derived from _#getCommandDto()_ , holds a string representation of the invoked action, or the edited property.


* `[teal]#*updater*#()` : `Updater`
+
 *NOT API* : intended to be called only by the framework.
