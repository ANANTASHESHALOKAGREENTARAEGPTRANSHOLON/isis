===========

*[Apache Isis](http://isis.apache.org)â„¢ software is a framework for rapidly developing domain-driven apps in Java.  Write your business logic in entities, domain services and repositories, and the framework dynamically generates a representation of that domain model as a webapp or a RESTful API. Use for prototyping or production.*

To see Isis in action, watch these [screencasts](http://isis.apache.org/getting-started/screencasts.html).

Get started yourself using the [Maven archetype](http://isis.apache.org/getting-started/quickstart-archetype.html).

## Screenshots
