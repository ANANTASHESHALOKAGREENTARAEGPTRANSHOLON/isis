[CAUTION]
====
The xref:docs:parent-pom:about.adoc[Parent POM] configures the Maven surefire plugin in two separate executions for unit test and fo integ tests.
This relies on a naming convention:

* unit tests, which must have a suffix `Test`, but excluding ...
* integ tests, which must have the suffix `IntegTest`

Not following this convention is likely to cause integ tests to fail.
