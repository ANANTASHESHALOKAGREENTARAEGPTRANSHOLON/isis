The framework has built-in support for all of the primitive data types, including `char`.

From this page you can:

* open a view model that uses the `char` datatype
* navigate to an entity that uses the `char` datatype

These pages also have actions that demonstrate the use of `char` as a parameter and as a return type.

Because `char` is a primitive value, the properties are mandatory.
