JAXB can be configured to support the Apache Isis `Blob` type using `@XmlJavaTypeAdapter`:

[source,java]
----
include::IsisBlobVm.java[tags=class]
----
<.> a no-arg constructor is required by JAXB
<.> required property as defined to JAXB
<.> directly editable property as defined to Apache Isis
<.> optional property as defined to Apache Isis.
+
This is the default for JAXB so no additional annotation required.
