Apache Isis applications can nominate a view model to act as the home page, using the link:https://isis.apache.org/refguide/${ISIS_VERSION}/applib-ant/HomePage.html[`@HomePage`] annotation:

[source,java]
----
@DomainObject(
    nature=Nature.VIEW_MODEL,
    objectType = "demo.Homepage"
)
@HomePage                                                       // <.>
public class DemoHomePage {

    public String title() {                                     // <.>
        return "Hello, " + userService.getUser().getName();
    }

    @Inject
    UserService userService;                                    // <.>
}
----

<.> declares this view-model class to be used as the viewer's homepage, there can be only one
<.> as displayed
<.> to determine the current user

This application's home page is pretty simple, not much more than a couple of hard-coded text fields that you're reading right now.

A more common implementation of a home page is as a dashboard, displaying the most useful current information to the user (perhaps a task list, or alerts).
Such a home page would have a number of repository services injected into it, in order to query and render those tasks or alerts.

It would probably also have the framework's link:https://isis.apache.org/refguide/${ISIS_VERSION}/applib-svc/UserService.html[`UserService`] injected, in order that the information displayed is relevant to the current user.
As you can see, this app's home page does actually do this, in order to "personalise" the title.
