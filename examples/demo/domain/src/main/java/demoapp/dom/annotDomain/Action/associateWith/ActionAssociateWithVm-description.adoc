The `associateWith` semantic specifies an action has a relationship with another property or another collection of the domain class.

* For properties, the association (currently) is used solely for layout purposes, so that the action will by default be rendered close to the property.
+
This can of course be overridden using `@ActionLayout` or the layout file

* For collections, the association is also used for layout purposes, rendering the action near to the collection.
+
However, it is also used at a deeper level, because the action may have a collection parameter which is the same type as the collection elements.
In the Wicket viewer, the collection is rendered with checkboxes; those selected objects are used as defaults for the action collection parameter.


== Associated with Properties

The `AssociateWithVm` defines two properties, `text` and `anotherProperty`:

[source,java]
----
include::ActionAssociateWithVm.java[tags=class]
----

The regular `updateText` action is associated with the `text` property:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::ActionAssociateWithVm.java[tags=action-associateWith-property]
----
<.> indicates the property to associate with
<.> if there are multiple actions associated with the property, indicates their order in the UI

Meanwhile the mixin `updateOtherProperty` is associated with the `otherProperty` property:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::ActionAssociateWithVm_updateOtherProperty.java[tags=class]
----
<.> indicates the property to associate with
<.> indicates their order in the UI


== Collection

[source,java]
----
include::ActionAssociateWithVm.java[tags=children]
----


[source,java]
----
include::child/ActionAssociateWithChildVm.java[tags=class]
----

[source,java]
----
include::ActionAssociateWithVm.java[tags=action-associateWith-collection]

== Mixin Actions

[source,java]
----
include::child/ActionAssociateWithVm_makeFavorite.java[tags=class]

[source,java]
