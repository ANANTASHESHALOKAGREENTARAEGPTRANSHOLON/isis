The `publishing` semantic for a domain object means that all registered implementation(s) of link:https://isis.apache.org/refguide/2.0.0-M3/applib-svc/PublisherService.html#spi[`PublisherService` SPI] will be notified of the identity and nature of change (created/updated/deleted) of the domain object.
This is done _after_ the interaction in which the object(s) was changed has completed.

This notification is done only once per interaction, so will include _all_ domain objects that were changed.
The event object can be converted to type xref:https://isis.apache.org/refguide/2.0.0-M3/schema/chg.html[ChangesDto].

NOTE: This is only supported for domain entities, not view models.

Common use cases are to replicate data to another system, or for gathering metrics (which objects are changed the most?).
A typical SPI implementation could publish the event over the network, or perhaps store in a database.
(Note that the framework provides an link:https://isis.apache.org/mappings/2.0.0-M3/outbox-publisher/about.html[out-of-the-box implementation] of the link:https://microservices.io/patterns/data/transactional-outbox.html[outbox pattern]).

The semantic can be specified using either the `@Property` annotation, or through a meta-annotation.

NOTE: The demo shows publishing of entities, as this is much more common use case than publishing a view model.

CAUTION: TODO

//== Annotated
//
//The `publisher` semantic can be specified explicitly using an annotation through `@Property#publishing()`:
//
//[source,java,indent=0]
//----
//include::PropertyPublishingJdo.java[tags=annotation]
//----
//<.> explicitly specifies that modifying the property should be published.
//
//The annotation could also be applied to a mixin, but would have little effect because mixin properties are always read-only.
//
//== Meta-annotated
//
//The `publishing` semantic can also be specified using a custom meta-annotation:
//
//* the meta-annotation is defined as:
//+
//[source,java]
//----
//include::PropertyPublishingEnabledMetaAnnotation.java[tags=class]
//----
//<.> annotated for a property
//<.> annotation can be applied to a property (either its getter or the field directly)
//
//* and can be applied to a property:
//+
//[source,java,indent=0]
//----
//include::PropertyPublishingJdo.java[tags=meta-annotated]
//----
//<.> semantic is inherited from the meta-annotation
//
//
//
//=== Meta-annotated Overridden
//
//The meta-annotation can itself be overridden:
//
//* in a property:
//+
//[source,java,indent=0]
//----
//include::PropertyPublishingJdo.java[tags=meta-annotated-overridden]
//----
//<.> semantic from meta-annotation ...
//<.> \... is overridden by the `@Property` annotation
//
//
//== PublisherService
//
//The demo provides a simple implementation of `PublisherService` that just stores the DTOs in memory:
//
//[source,java]
//----
//include::spiimpl/PublisherServiceSpiForProperties.java[tags=class]
//----
//<.> serializes to `InteractionDto`, as defined by the link:https://isis.apache.org/refguide/2.0.0-M3/schema/ixn.html[Apache Isis schema].
//
//The demo implementation also provides a way to query these executions:
//
//[source,java,indent=0]
//----
//include::spiimpl/PublisherServiceSpiForProperties.java[tags=demo]
//----
//
//Supporting mixins surface this list as contributions on the object:
//
//* `interactionExecutions` collection:
//+
//[source,java,indent=0]
//----
//include::spiimpl/PropertyPublishingJdo_interactionExecutions.java[tags=class]
//----
//
//* `clearInteractionExecutions` action:
//+
//[source,java,indent=0]
//----
//include::spiimpl/PropertyPublishingJdo_clearInteractionExecutions.java[tags=class]
//----
//
