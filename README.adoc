# About

kroViz is a viewer for http://www.restfulobjects.org[Restful Objects] written in Kotlin/JS. 
It's a generic client for applications that implement the Restful Objects Specification. 
An https://isis.apache.org/[Apache Isis] application with the restful objects interface enabled 
(https://github.com/apache/isis/tree/master/example/application/simpleapp[SimpleApp], https://github.com/isisaddons/isis-app-todoapp[ToDoApp] , etc.) can be used for the server part. 

A http://nakedobjects.net/home/index.shtml[Naked Objects for .NET] application should work as well, but is not tested yet.

## How will the UI look like?

CAUTION: Screenshots are from a previous version (roViz, written in ActionScript)  

TIP: After entering url, userId, password in the Connect Dialog (Main -> Connect), the menu gets populated. Actions (here: SimpleObjects.listAll) can be selected and a Tab with a table is displayed:

TIP: Clicking on the StatusBar at the bottom will create another tab showing logged XmlHttpRequests:

TIP: Remote applications (here: http://semat.ofbizian.com/[SEMAT]) can be used as well, and even mixed with local apps.

### Elements of the UI
You'll likely find Actions in a ContextMenu (right mouse button).
UI specific (ie. non domain) actions supported on 

* Tabs (Label)
** Close
** Dock

* LogEntries Table
** Delete (multiple selection possible)

* Status Bar
** Left click opens LogEntries tab

## Bugs
CAUTION: Sequence of menu entries is random. Use layout.xml

CAUTION: LogEntries are not updated automatically


## Next 
* Integrate Calendar View (for ToDo App)
* Fullblown GanttChart (incl. birds eye view)
* Visualize Geolocations (cf. https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Frameworks)
* Display SVG's (cf. https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/org.w3c.dom.svg/index.html)
* Use SQL lite as store for url/credentials, customized layouts
* Visualize DomainModel (reconstruct from DomainObjects, Attributes, etc.)
* Hook up to the internal event bus of the server to have change notifications pushed. 
Callback server before display/edit.
