= Configuration Properties

Apache Isis' is a Spring Boot application, and so is typically configured using an `application.properties` or `application.yml` file.


The configuration can be obtained from a variety of external locations; see the link:https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/spring-boot-features.html#boot-features-external-config[Spring Boot] documentation for more details.

TIP: The xref:docs:starters:about.adoc[starter apps] use `application.yml` for configuration that doesn't change between environments, and `config/application.properties` for settings (such as JDBC URL) that does vary.

This chapter describes the configuration properties available to configure an Apache Isis application.
