Apache Isis distinguishes between the application being run in prototyping mode vs running in production mode.
The framework calls this the "deployment type" (corresponding internally to the `DeploymentType` class).

A similar concept appears in the link:https://wicket.apache.org[Wicket] framework (which is the library with which the xref:vw:ROOT:about.adoc[Wicket viewer] is implemented, of course).

* the term "deployment type" is called the runtime "configuration" by Wicket
* the _prototyping_ deployment type corresponds to Wicket's _development_ configuration
* the _production_ deployment type corresponds to Wicket's _deployment_ configuration

By default Apache Isis runs in production mode.
If running in prototyping mode, then any actions xref:refguide:applib-ant:Action.adoc#restrictto[restricted to] to prototype mode are visible.
In particular, the "Prototyping" menu will appear, containing a number of framework-provided menu services - all restricted to prototyping mode.
For example, menu items to run in xref:testing:fixtures:about.adoc[fixture scripts] are on this menu.

Prototyping mode can be enabled in a number of ways:

* environment variable:
+
[source,bash]
----
export PROTOTYPING=true
----

* `PRODUCTION` system property
+
[source,bash]
----
-DPROTOTYPING=true
----

* `isis.deploymentType` system property
+
[source,bash]
----
-Disis.deploymentType=PROTOTYPING
----

It is also possible to explicitly specify production mode:

* `PRODUCTION` system property
+
[source,bash]
----
-DPROTOTYPING=false
----

* `isis.deploymentType` system property
+
[source,bash]
----
-Disis.deploymentType=PRODUCTION
----

If (by a combination of mechanisms) both prototyping and production modes are specified, then production mode wins.


== `IsisSystemEnvironment` service

Applications can discover the prototyping mode by injecting the xref:refguide:applib-svc:testing/IsisSystemEnvironment.adoc[IsisSystemEnvironment] service.
