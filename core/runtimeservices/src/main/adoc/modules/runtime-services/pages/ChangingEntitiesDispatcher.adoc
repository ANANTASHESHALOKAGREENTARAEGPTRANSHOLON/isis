The (internal) `ChangingEntitiesDispatcher` service acts as an internal facade to any configured xref:refguide:applib-svc:ChangingEntitiesListener.adoc[`ChangingEntitiesListener`] domain service(s).

For changing entities, it provides an API for the framework to call at the end of the interaction; it obtains details of the changed entities (from the xref:core:runtime-services:ChangedObjectsService.adoc[`ChangedObjectsService`]) and filters them to just those objects that are to be published; these are then passed through to any configured `ChangingEntitiesListener` implementations.


== SPI and Implementation

The SPI of the service is:

[source,java]
----
public class ChangingEntitiesDispatcher {

	void dispatchChangingEntities(...);   // <1>
	
}
----
<1> to dispatch all changing entities that are to be published (with the xref:refguide:applib-ant:DomainObject.adoc#publishing[`@DomainObject#publishing`] annotation attribute or equivalent).

. *Execution*: dispatched via `ExecutionDispatcher` and subscribed to via `ExecutionListener` (SPI)
