/**
 * A rendering hint, instructing the viewer that the date should as one day prior to

 * <p>
 * This is intended to be used so that an exclusive end date of an interval
 * can be rendered as 1 day before the actual value stored.
 * 
 * <p>
 * For example:
 * <pre>
 * public LocalDate getStartDate() { ... }
 * 
 * &#64;RenderedAsDayBefore
 * public LocalDate getEndDate() { ... }
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Here, the interval of the [1-may-2013,1-jun-2013) would be rendered as the dates
 * 1-may-2013 for the start date but using 31-may-2013 (the day before) for the end date.  What is stored
 * In the domain object, itself, however, the value stored is 1-jun-2013.
